      "summary": "This study evaluates two leading approaches for teaching construction robots new skills to understand their applicability for construction automation: a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. The goal is to understand both task performance and the practical effort needed to deploy each approach on real jobs. The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload. Overall, the findings indicate that VLA offers practical advantages for changing tasks by reducing programming effort and enabling useful performance with minimal data, while DQN provides a viable baseline when sufficient tuning effort is acceptable.",

      "summary": "Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.",

      "summary": "Dynamic prediction of locomotor capacity after stroke is crucial for tailoring rehabilitation, yet current assessments provide only static impairment scores and do not indicate whether patients can safely perform specific tasks such as slope walking or stair climbing. Here, we develop a data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs an individual stroke survivor's neuromuscular control from a single 20 m level-ground walking trial and predicts task-conditioned locomotion across rehabilitation scenarios. The system combines wearable-sensor kinematics, a proportional-derivative physics controller, a population Healthy Motion Atlas, and goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning with behaviour cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning to generate physically plausible, patient-specific gait simulations for slopes and stairs. In 11 stroke survivors, the personalized controllers preserved idiosyncratic gait patterns while improving joint-angle and endpoint fidelity by 4.73% and 12.10%, respectively, and reducing training time to 25.56% relative to a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot involving 21 inpatients, clinicians who used our locomotion predictions to guide task selection and difficulty obtained larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores over 28 days of standard rehabilitation than control clinicians (mean change 6.0 versus 3.7 points). These findings indicate that our generative, task-predictive framework can augment clinical decision-making in post-stroke gait rehabilitation and provide a template for dynamically personalized motor recovery strategies.",

      "summary": "Sketch editing is central to digital illustration, yet existing image editing systems struggle to preserve the sparse, style-sensitive structure of line art while supporting both high-level semantic changes and precise local redrawing. We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines. Together, our dataset and SketchAssist provide a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision.",

      "summary": "We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\\% to 6.9\\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.",

      "summary": "Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.",

Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$Δ$ are provided.

      "summary": "Many practical decision-making problems involve tasks whose success depends on the entire system history, rather than on achieving a state with desired properties. Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.",

      "summary": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.",

Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.",

BATADAL benchmark data is a good source of testing intrusion detection techniques, but it presents several important problems, such as imbalance in the number of classes, multivariate time dependence, and stealthy attacks. We consider a hybrid ensemble learning model that will enhance the detection ability of cyber-attacks in WDS by using the complementary capabilities of machine learning and deep learning models. Three base learners, namely, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting , and Long Short-Term Memory network, have been strictly compared and seven ensemble types using simple averaged and stacked learning with a logistic regression meta-learner. Random Forest analysis identified top predictors turned into temporal and statistical features, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to overcome the class imbalance issue. The analyics indicates that the single Long Short-Term Memory network model is of poor performance (F1 = 0.000, AUC = 0.4460), but tree-based models, especially eXtreme Gradient Boosting, perform well (F1 = 0.7470, AUC=0.9684). The hybrid stacked ensemble of Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting , and Long Short-Term Memory network scored the highest, with the attack class of 0.7205 with an F1-score and a AUC of 0.9826 indicating that the heterogeneous stacking between model precision and generalization can work. The proposed framework establishes a robust and scalable solution for cyber-attack detection in time-dependent industrial systems, integrating temporal learning and ensemble diversity to support the secure operation of critical infrastructure.",

By generating large volumes of high-fidelity simulated scenarios and pairing them with automated labeling and model training, the pipeline enables rapid iteration on perception, navigation, and decision-making capabilities without the cost, risk, or time constraints of extensive field trials. The resulting datasets can be tuned quickly for new operational environments and threat conditions, supporting both baseline humanoid performance and advanced subsystems such as multimodal sensing, counter-detection survivability, and CBRNE-relevant reconnaissance behaviors.

      "summary": "Teleoperation presents a promising paradigm for remote control and robot proprioceptive data collection. Despite recent progress, current teleoperation systems still suffer from limitations in efficiency and ergonomics, particularly in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose CaFe-TeleVision, a coarse-to-fine teleoperation system with immersive situated visualization for enhanced ergonomics. At its core, a coarse-to-fine control mechanism is proposed in the retargeting module to bridge workspace disparities, jointly optimizing efficiency and physical ergonomics. To stream immersive feedback with adequate visual cues for human vision systems, an on-demand situated visualization technique is integrated in the perception module, which reduces the cognitive load for multi-view processing. The system is built on a humanoid collaborative robot and validated with six challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. User study among 24 participants confirms that CaFe-TeleVision enhances ergonomics with statistical significance, indicating a lower task load and a higher user acceptance during teleoperation. Quantitative results also validate the superior performance of our system across six tasks, surpassing comparative methods by up to 28.89% in success rate and accelerating by 26.81% in completion time.

      "summary": "Human communication is inherently multimodal and social: words, prosody, and body language jointly carry intent. Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond \"speech-conditioned motion generation\" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

      "summary": "The performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents depends critically on the quality of the underlying feature representations. Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincaré Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%. On Atari-5 with Double DQN, Hyper++ strongly outperforms Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines. We release our code at https://github.com/Probabilistic-and-Interactive-ML/hyper-rl .",

      "summary": "Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated strong potential for large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks by fitting the appearance of images. However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.",

This paper presents SUPER (Sensitivity-based Uncertainty-aware PErformance and Risk assessment) that is a generic and explainable framework that propagates uncertainties via sensitivities for real-time risk assessment in VIO. The scientific novelty lies in the derivation of a real-time risk indicator that is backend-agnostic and exploits the Schur complement blocks of the Gauss-Newton normal matrix to propagate uncertainties. Practically, the Schur complement captures the sensitivity that reflects the influence of the uncertainty on the risk occurrence. Our framework estimates risks on the basis of the residual magnitudes, geometric conditioning, and short horizon temporal trends without requiring ground truth knowledge. Our framework enables to reliably predict trajectory degradation 50 frames ahead with an improvement of 20% to the baseline. In addition, SUPER initiates a stop or relocalization policy with 89.1% recall. The framework is backend agnostic and operates in real time with less than 0.2% additional CPU cost. Experiments show that SUPER provides consistent uncertainty estimates. A SLAM evaluation highlights the applicability to long horizon mapping.",

      "summary": "Object detection models deployed in real-world applications such as autonomous driving face serious threats from backdoor attacks. Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.\n  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner.\n  Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis.\n  Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications.\n  Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) enables robots to operate in uncertain environments, but standard approaches often struggle with poor generalization to unseen tasks. Context-adaptive meta reinforcement learning addresses these limitations by conditioning on the task representation, yet they mostly rely on complete action information in the experience making task inference tightly coupled to a specific policy. This paper introduces Context Representation via Action Free Transformer encoder decoder (CRAFT), a belief model that infers task representations solely from sequences of states and rewards. By removing the dependence on actions, CRAFT decouples task inference from policy optimization, supports modular training, and leverages amortized variational inference for scalable belief updates. Built on a transformer encoder decoder with rotary positional embeddings, the model captures long range temporal dependencies and robustly encodes both parametric and non-parametric task variations. Experiments on the MetaWorld ML-10 robotic manipulation benchmark show that CRAFT achieves faster adaptation, improved generalization, and more effective exploration compared to context adaptive meta--RL baselines. These findings highlight the potential of action-free inference as a foundation for scalable RL in robotic control.",

While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

      "summary": "We introduce WaveSim, a multi-scale similarity metric for the evaluation of spatial fields in weather and climate applications. WaveSim exploits wavelet transforms to decompose input fields into scale-specific wavelet coefficients. The metric is built by multiplying three orthogonal components derived from these coefficients: Magnitude, which quantifies similarities in the energy distribution of the coefficients, i.e., the intensity of the field; Displacement, which captures spatial shift by comparing the centers of mass of normalized energy distributions; and Structure, which assesses pattern organization independent of location and amplitude. Each component yields a scale-specific similarity score ranging from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity), which are then combined across scales to produce an overall similarity measure. We first evaluate WaveSim using synthetic test cases, applying controlled spatial and temporal perturbations to systematically assess its sensitivity and expected behavior. We then demonstrate its applicability to physically relevant case studies of key modes of climate variability in Earth System Models. Traditional point-wise metrics lack a mechanism for attributing errors to physical scales or modes of dissimilarity. By operating in the wavelet domain and decomposing the signal along independent axes, WaveSim bypasses these limitations and provides an interpretable and diagnostically rich framework for assessing similarity in complex fields. Additionally, the WaveSim framework allows users to place emphasis on a specific scale or component, and lends itself to user-specific model intercomparison, model evaluation, and calibration and training of forecasting systems. We provide a PyTorch-ready implementation of WaveSim, along with all evaluation scripts, at: https://github.com/gabrieleaccarino/wavesim.",

      "summary": "Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.",

      "summary": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy.

      "summary": "This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.",

Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.\n  To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER. RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.",

      "summary": "Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.",

Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.",

      "summary": "Video recognition systems are increasingly being deployed in daily life, such as content recommendation and security monitoring. To enhance video recognition development, many institutions have released high-quality public datasets with open-source licenses for training advanced models. At the same time, these datasets are also susceptible to misuse and infringement. Dataset copyright auditing is an effective solution to identify such unauthorized use. However, existing dataset copyright solutions primarily focus on the image domain; the complex nature of video data leaves dataset copyright auditing in the video domain unexplored. Specifically, video data introduces an additional temporal dimension, which poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and stealthiness of existing methods.\n  In this paper, we propose VICTOR, the first dataset copyright auditing approach for video recognition systems. We develop a general and stealthy sample modification strategy that enhances the output discrepancy of the target model. By modifying only a small proportion of samples (e.g., 1%), VICTOR amplifies the impact of published modified samples on the prediction behavior of the target models. Then, the difference in the model's behavior for published modified and unpublished original samples can serve as a key basis for dataset auditing. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets highlight the superiority of VICTOR. Finally, we show that VICTOR is robust in the presence of several perturbation mechanisms to the training videos or the target models.",

      "summary": "The development and evaluation of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems requires a precise ground truth. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is often used as a foundation for this, but its signals can be unreliable in obstructed environments due to multi-path effects or loss-of-signal. While existing datasets compensate for the sporadic loss of GNSS signals by incorporating Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, the commonly used Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)-based systems do not permit the prolonged study of GNSS-denied environments. To close this gap, we present Odyssey, a LIO dataset with a focus on GNSS-denied environments such as tunnels and parking garages as well as other underrepresented, yet ubiquitous situations such as stop-and-go-traffic, bumpy roads and wide open fields. Our ground truth is derived from a navigation-grade Inertial Navigation System (INS) equipped with a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG), offering exceptional bias stability characteristics compared to IMUs used in existing datasets and enabling the prolonged and accurate study of GNSS-denied environments. This makes Odyssey the first publicly available dataset featuring a RLG-based INS. Besides providing data for LIO, we also support other tasks, such as place recognition, through the threefold repetition of all trajectories as well as the integration of external mapping data by providing precise geodetic coordinates. All data, dataloader and other material is available online at https://odyssey.uni-goettingen.de/ .",

ExpanDyNeRF optimizes density and color features to improve scene reconstruction from challenging perspectives.

      "summary": "For decades, focal non-invasive neuromodulation of deep brain regions has not been possible because of the steep depth-focality trade-off of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or classical transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Deep brain stimulation has therefore largely relied on invasive approaches in clinical populations, requiring surgery. Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a promising method to overcome this challenge and allows for the first time focal non-invasive electrical deep brain stimulation. The method, which was first validated through computational modeling and rodent work, has now been successfully translated to humans to target deep brain regions such as the hippocampus or striatum. In this Perspective, we present current evidence for tTIS-based neuromodulation, underlying mechanisms and discuss future developments of this promising technology. More specifically, we highlight key opportunities and challenges for fundamental neuroscience as well as for the design of new interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the status of understanding and challenges regarding the basic mechanisms of action of tTIS and possible lines of technological innovation to optimize stimulation, in particular in terms of intensity and focality. Overall, we suggest that following the first proof-of-concepts, an important multidisciplinary research effort is now required to further validate the use of tTIS in multiple applications, understand its underlying principles and optimize the technology in the view of a wider scientific and clinical deployment.",

Although many explanation methods are dedicated to bringing the obscurity of DNNs to light, they exhibit significant limitations: post-hoc explanation methods often struggle to faithfully reflect model behaviors, while self-explaining neural networks sacrifice performance and compatibility due to their specialized architectural designs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, which achieves two key advancements: 1) a fair allocation of the model prediction scores to image patches, ensuring explanations inherently align with the model's decision logic, and 2) enhanced interpretability with minor structural modifications, preserving model performance and compatibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art interpretability.",

      "summary": "Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.",

However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.",

      "summary": "The interest in the usage of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) for forest applications has increased in recent years. While above-canopy flight has reached a high level of autonomy, navigating under-canopy remains a significant challenge. The use of autonomous UAVs could reduce the burden of data collection, which has motivated the development of numerous solutions for under-canopy autonomous flight. However, the experiments conducted in the literature and their reporting lack rigor. Very rarely, the density and the difficulty of the test forests are reported, or multiple flights are flown, and the success rate of those flights is reported. The aim of this study was to implement an autonomously flying quadrotor based on a lightweight lidar using openly available algorithms and test its behavior in real forest environments. A set of rigorous experiments was conducted with a quadrotor prototype utilizing the IPC path planner and LTA-OM SLAM algorithm. Based on the results of the first 33 flights, the original system was further enhanced. With the optimized system, 60 flights were performed, resulting in a total of 93 test flights. The optimized system performed significantly better in terms of reliability and flight mission completion times, achieving success rates of 12/15 in a medium-density forest and 15/15 in a dense forest, at a target flight velocity of 1 m/s. At a target flight velocity of 2 m/s, it had a success rate of 12/15 and 5/15, respectively. Furthermore, a standardized testing setup and evaluation criteria were proposed, enabling consistent performance comparisons of autonomous under-canopy UAV systems, enhancing reproducibility, guiding system improvements, and accelerating progress in forest robotics.",

Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.",

These may appear as gradual drifts, transient fluctuations, or abrupt shifts, demanding real-time adaptation that is robust to short-term variation yet responsive to lasting change. We propose a framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems that can be updated in real time from streaming data. The method decouples representation learning from online adaptation, using latent representations learned offline to support online closed-form Bayesian updates. To handle evolving conditions, we introduce a changepoint-aware mechanism with a latent variable inferred from data likelihoods that indicates continuity or shift. When continuity is likely, evidence accumulates to refine predictions; when a shift is detected, past information is tempered to enable rapid re-learning. This maintains calibrated uncertainty and supports probabilistic reasoning about transient, gradual, or structural change. We prove that the adaptive regret of the framework grows only logarithmically in time and linearly with the number of shifts, competitive with an oracle that knows timings of shift. We validate on cartpole simulations and real quadrotor flights with swinging payloads and mid-flight drops, showing improved predictive accuracy, faster recovery, and more accurate closed-loop tracking than relevant baselines.",

      "summary": "Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful paradigm for representation learning without manual annotations. However, most existing frameworks focus on global alignment and struggle to capture the hierarchical, multi-scale lesion patterns characteristic of plant disease imagery. To address this gap, we propose PSMamba, a progressive self-supervised framework that integrates the efficient sequence modelling of Vision Mamba (VM) with a dual-student hierarchical distillation strategy. Unlike conventional single teacher-student designs, PSMamba employs a shared global teacher and two specialised students: one processes mid-scale views to capture lesion distributions and vein structures, while the other focuses on local views to capture fine-grained cues such as texture irregularities and early-stage lesions. This multi-granular supervision facilitates the joint learning of contextual and detailed representations, with consistency losses ensuring coherent cross-scale alignment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PSMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in both domain-shifted and fine-grained scenarios.",

      "summary": "Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.\n  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.\n  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.\n  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.",

Unlike prior approaches that construct 4D representations by optimizing over 3D or video generative models, we train a generator directly on 4D data, achieving high fidelity, temporal coherence, and structural consistency. At the core of our method is a compressed set of structured spacetime latents. Specifically, (1) To address the scarcity of 4D training data, we build on a pre-trained single-image-to-3D model, preserving strong spatial consistency. (2) Temporal consistency is enforced by introducing dedicated temporal layers that reason across frames. (3) To support efficient training and inference over long video sequences, we compress the latent sequence along the temporal axis using factorized 4D convolutions and temporal downsampling blocks. In addition, we employ a carefully designed training strategy to enhance robustness against occlusion",

      "summary": "Predicting driver attention is a critical problem for developing explainable autonomous driving systems and understanding driver behavior in mixed human-autonomous vehicle traffic scenarios. Although significant progress has been made through large-scale driver attention datasets and deep learning architectures, existing works are constrained by narrow frontal field-of-view and limited driving diversity. Consequently, they fail to capture the full spatial context of driving environments, especially during lane changes, turns, and interactions involving peripheral objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we introduce DriverGaze360, a large-scale 360$^\\circ$ field of view driver attention dataset, containing $\\sim$1 million gaze-labeled frames collected from 19 human drivers, enabling comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior. Moreover, our panoramic attention prediction approach, DriverGaze360-Net, jointly learns attention maps and attended objects by employing an auxiliary semantic segmentation head. This improves spatial awareness and attention prediction across wide panoramic inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art attention prediction performance on multiple metrics on panoramic driving images.

FLAME utilizes the Legendre Memory for strong generalization capabilities. Through adapting variants of Legendre Memory, i.e., translated Legendre (LegT) and scaled Legendre (LegS), in the Encoding and Decoding phases, FLAME can effectively capture the inherent inductive bias within data and make efficient long-range inferences. To enhance the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting while keeping efficient, FLAME adopts a Normalization Flow based forecasting head, which can model the arbitrarily intricate distributions over the forecasting horizon in a generative manner. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of FLAME on both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting tasks.",

We present Elastic3D, a controllable, direct end-to-end method for upgrading a conventional video to a binocular one. Our approach, based on (conditional) latent diffusion, avoids artifacts due to explicit depth estimation and warping. The key to its high-quality stereo video output is a novel, guided VAE decoder that ensures sharp and epipolar-consistent stereo video output. Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob. Experiments on three different datasets of real-world stereo videos show that our method outperforms both traditional warping-based and recent warping-free baselines and sets a new standard for reliable, controllable stereo video conversion.

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation.",

To explain the empirical success of teacher-based filtering, we characterize the performance of filtered contrastive learning under the standard bimodal data generation model. Denoting $η\\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\\frac{1}{η\\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ηn}}$ in the large $η$ regime, and by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $η$ regime.",

Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.",

      "summary": "We consider the problem of cooperative manipulation by a mobile multi-manipulator system operating in obstacle-cluttered and highly constrained environments under spatio-temporal task specifications. The task requires transporting a grasped object while respecting both continuous robot dynamics and discrete geometric constraints arising from obstacles and narrow passages. To address this hybrid structure, we propose a multi-rate planning and control framework that combines offline generation of an STL-satisfying object trajectory and collision-free base footprints with online constrained inverse kinematics and continuous-time feedback control. The resulting closed-loop system enables coordinated reconfiguration of multiple manipulators while tracking the desired object motion. The approach is evaluated in high-fidelity physics simulations using three Franka Emika Panda mobile manipulators rigidly grasping an object.",

Beyond selecting which samples to label, several DAL approaches further enhance data efficiency by augmenting the training set with synthetic inputs that do not require additional manual labeling. In this work, we investigate how augmenting the training data with adversarial inputs that violate robustness constraints can improve DAL performance. We show that adversarial examples generated via formal verification contribute substantially more than those produced by standard, gradient-based attacks. We apply this extension to multiple modern DAL techniques, as well as to a new technique that we propose, and show that it yields significant improvements in model generalization across standard benchmarks.",

      "summary": "Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely \"think with images\" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.",

We introduce LAPPI (LLM-Assisted Preference-based Problem Instantiation), an interactive approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to support users in this instantiation process. Through natural language conversations, the system helps users transform vague preferences into well-defined optimization problems. These instantiated problems are then passed to existing optimization solvers to generate solutions. In a user study on trip planning, our method successfully captured user preferences and generated feasible plans that outperformed both conventional and prompt-engineering approaches.

To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time.

      "summary": "Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.",

      "summary": "Despite significant progress in text-driven 4D human-object interaction (HOI) generation with supervised methods, the scalability remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.",

      "summary": "We present a method for jointly recovering the appearance and internal structure of botanical plants from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance. Experiments show that the GaussianPlant achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling the extraction of branch structure and leaf instances.",

A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fréchet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning. Numerical examples on nonlinear diffusion--reaction, Helmholtz, and Navier--Stokes equations demonstrate that DIFNOs are superior in sample complexity for operator learning and solving infinite-dimensional PDE-constrained inverse problems, achieving high accuracy at low training sample sizes.",

The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.",

      "summary": "Inference with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) is expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has emerged as an effective solution to this problem, however, the number of the calls to the draft model for generating candidate tokens in speculative sampling is a preset hyperparameter, lacking flexibility. To generate and utilize the candidate tokens more effectively, we propose RADAR, a novel speculative sampling method with RL-based dynamic draft trees. RADAR formulates the draft tree generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model, which enables real-time decision on the calls to the draft model, reducing redundant computations and further accelerating inference. Evaluations across three LLMs and four tasks show that RADAR achieves a speedup of 3.17x-4.82x over the auto-regressive decoding baseline.

      "summary": "The scaling of large language models (LLMs) emphasizes increasing depth, yet performance gains diminish with added layers. Prior work introduces the concept of \"effective depth\", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting.

      "summary": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.",

      "summary": "The ability to adapt to changing environments is crucial for the autonomous navigation systems of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, existing navigation systems adopt fixed execution configurations without considering environmental dynamics based on available computing resources, e.g., with a high execution frequency and task workload. This static approach causes rigid flight strategies and excessive computations, ultimately degrading flight performance or even leading to failures in UAVs. Despite the necessity for an adaptive system, dynamically adjusting workloads remains challenging, due to difficulties in quantifying environmental complexity and modeling the relationship between environment and system configuration. Aiming at adapting to dynamic environments, this paper proposes E-Navi, an environmental-adaptive navigation system for UAVs that dynamically adjusts task executions on the CPUs in response to environmental changes based on available computational resources. Specifically, the perception-planning pipeline of UAVs navigation system is redesigned through dynamic adaptation of mapping resolution and execution frequency, driven by the quantitative environmental complexity evaluations. In addition, E-Navi supports flexible deployment across hardware platforms with varying levels of computing capability. Extensive Hardware-In-the-Loop and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system significantly outperforms the baseline method across various hardware platforms, achieving up to 53.9% navigation task workload reduction, up to 63.8% flight time savings, and delivering more stable velocity control.",

      "summary": "The deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving (AD) is critically hindered by reliability failures, most notably object hallucination. This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and \"zoom in\" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward. This reward not only eliminates the need for dense labels but also circumvents the instability of external tool calls by enforcing real-time cross-modal consistency between the visual focus and the textual reasoning. Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 demonstrate our model's significant improvements. Compared to the baseline Qwen2.5VL-7B, OmniDrive-R1 improves the overall reasoning score from 51.77% to 80.35%, and the final answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62%.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLM) hold potential to support dairy scholars and farmers by supporting decision-making and broadening access to knowledge for stakeholders with limited technical expertise. However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions.",

However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters.",

For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.\n  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation. We evaluate our approach on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the state of the art. Project Page: https://github.com/ialzugaray/ace-slam",

      "summary": "We consider the problem of active 3D imaging using single-shot structured light systems, which are widely employed in commercial 3D sensing devices such as Apple Face ID and Intel RealSense. Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

      "summary": "Multi-modal learning integrating medical images and tabular data has significantly advanced clinical decision-making in recent years. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining these models on large-scale unlabeled image-tabular data, aiming to learn discriminative representations. However, existing SSL methods for image-tabular representation learning are often confined to specific data cohorts, mainly due to their rigid tabular modeling mechanisms when modeling heterogeneous tabular data. This inter-tabular barrier hinders the multi-modal SSL methods from effectively learning transferrable medical knowledge shared across diverse cohorts. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL framework, namely CITab, designed to learn powerful multi-modal feature representations in a cross-tabular manner. We design the tabular modeling mechanism from a semantic-awareness perspective by integrating column headers as semantic cues, which facilitates transferrable knowledge learning and the scalability in utilizing multiple data sources for pretraining. Additionally, we propose a prototype-guided mixture-of-linear layer (P-MoLin) module for tabular feature specialization, empowering the model to effectively handle the heterogeneity of tabular data and explore the underlying medical concepts. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis task across three publicly available data cohorts containing 4,461 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that CITab outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for effective and scalable cross-tabular multi-modal learning.",

      "summary": "The rise of AI agents is transforming how software can be built. The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines.",

Shah and Peters (2020) showed that, contrary to the unconditional case, no universally finite-sample valid test can ever achieve nontrivial power. While informative, this result (based on \"hiding\" dependence) does not seem to explain the frequent practical failures observed with popular CI tests. We investigate the Kernel-based Conditional Independence (KCI) test - of which we show the Generalized Covariance Measure underlying many recent tests is nearly a special case - and identify the major factors underlying its practical behavior. We highlight the key role of errors in the conditional mean embedding estimate for the Type-I error, while pointing out the importance of selecting an appropriate conditioning kernel (not recognized in previous work) as being necessary for good test power but also tending to inflate Type-I error.",

Applying these methods in practice can require discarding valuable data, unnecessarily reducing test power. We address this long-standing limitation by extending the theory of generalized U-statistics and applying it to the usual MMD estimator, resulting in new characterization of the asymptotic distributions of the MMD estimator with unequal sample sizes (particularly outside the proportional regimes required by previous partial results). This generalization also provides a new criterion for optimizing the power of an MMD test with unequal sample sizes. Our approach preserves all available data, enhancing test accuracy and applicability in realistic settings. Along the way, we give much cleaner characterizations of the variance of MMD estimators, revealing something that might be surprising to those in the area: while zero MMD implies a degenerate estimator, it is sometimes possible to have a degenerate estimator with nonzero MMD as well; we give a construction and a proof that it does not happen in common situations.",

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.",

This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.",

However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.",

This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data. Our experiment shows that VASA-3D produces realistic 3D talking heads that cannot be achieved by prior art, and it supports the online generation of 512x512 free-viewpoint videos at up to 75 FPS, facilitating more immersive engagements with lifelike 3D avatars.",

      "summary": "Contemporary reservoir computing relies heavily on smooth, globally Lipschitz continuous activation functions, limiting applications in defense, disaster response, and pharmaceutical modeling where robust operation under extreme conditions is critical. We systematically investigate non-smooth activation functions, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal variants, in echo state networks. Through comprehensive parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations, we demonstrate that several non-smooth functions not only maintain the Echo State Property (ESP) but outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance. Notably, the Cantor function (continuous everywhere and flat almost everywhere) maintains ESP-consistent behavior up to spectral radii of rho ~ 10, an order of magnitude beyond typical bounds for smooth functions, while achieving 2.6x faster convergence than tanh and ReLU. We introduce a theoretical framework for quantized activation functions, defining a Degenerate Echo State Property (d-ESP) that captures stability for discrete-output functions and proving that d-ESP implies traditional ESP. We identify a critical crowding ratio Q=N/k (reservoir size / quantization levels) that predicts failure thresholds for discrete activations. Our analysis reveals that preprocessing topology, rather than continuity per se, determines stability: monotone, compressive preprocessing maintains ESP across scales, while dispersive or discontinuous preprocessing triggers sharp failures. While our findings challenge assumptions about activation function design in reservoir computing, the mechanism underlying the exceptional performance of certain fractal functions remains unexplained, suggesting fundamental gaps in our understanding of how geometric properties of activation functions influence reservoir dynamics.",

Previous methods for articulated object reconstruction either rely on slow optimization with fragile cross-state correspondences or use feed-forward models limited to specific object categories. In contrast, ART treats articulated objects as assemblies of rigid parts, formulating reconstruction as part-based prediction. Our newly designed transformer architecture maps sparse image inputs to a set of learnable part slots, from which ART jointly decodes unified representations for individual parts, including their 3D geometry, texture, and explicit articulation parameters. The resulting reconstructions are physically interpretable and readily exportable for simulation. Trained on a large-scale, diverse dataset with per-part supervision, and evaluated across diverse benchmarks, ART achieves significant improvements over existing baselines and establishes a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs.",

      "summary": "CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture. Our method has the potential for quantitative tumor measurement in clinical practice, supporting diagnosis and prognosis.",

However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.",

While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.",

Unlike existing methods that measure cumulative topological presence, we introduce the first velocity-based perspective on persistence diagrams, measuring the rate at which features appear and disappear, automatically downweighting noise through overlap-based weighting. We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons. Our results show that modeling topological velocity is crucial for detecting structural anomalies in dynamic networks.",

WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations. However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging. We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets. First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts. Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks. In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",

Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.",

      "summary": "The convergence behavior of classical iterative solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is often highly sensitive to the domain and specific discretization of PDEs. Previously, we introduced hybrid solvers by combining the classical solvers with neural operators for a specific geometry 1, but they tend to under-perform in geometries not encountered during training. To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations. Geo-DeepONet enables accurate operator learning across arbitrary unstructured meshes without requiring retraining. Building on this, we develop a class of geometry-aware hybrid preconditioned iterative solvers by coupling Geo-DeepONet with traditional methods such as relaxation schemes and Krylov subspace algorithms. Through numerical experiments on parametric PDEs posed over diverse unstructured domains, we demonstrate the enhanced robustness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid solvers for multiple real-world applications.",

      "summary": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and efficient predictive tools that support early intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on handcrafted features and clinician expertise, while machine learning methods improve reproducibility but often struggle to generalize across noisy and heterogeneous clinical data. In this work, we propose Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention, a compact deep learning architecture designed for tabular clinical records. The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features. These results demonstrate that lightweight hybrid recurrent and attention-based architectures provide a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for clinical risk prediction, supporting deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings.",

However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability. We emphasize the need for actionable, purpose-driven interventions that are feasible in real-world contexts for the users of such applications.",

However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.",

By predicting performance early in the communication phase, potentially sluggish transfers can be identified and selectively monitored, optimizing network usage and overall performance. A key bottleneck to improving the predictive power of machine learning (ML) models in this context is the issue of class imbalance. This project focuses on addressing the class imbalance problem to enhance the accuracy of performance predictions. In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance. While augmentation may improve performance, as the imbalance ratio increases, the performance does not significantly improve. We conclude that even the most advanced technique, such as CTGAN, does not significantly improve over simple stratified sampling.",

Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.",

This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration. The dataset is designed to support supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and segmentation. Its diversity in texture and construction techniques also enables investigation of model generalization and transferability across tunnel types. By addressing the critical lack of domain-specific data, this dataset contributes to advancing automated tunnel inspection and promoting safer, more efficient infrastructure maintenance strategies.",

In this work, we introduce Kinetic-Mamba, a Mamba-based neural operator framework that integrates the expressive power of neural operators with the efficient temporal modeling capabilities of Mamba architectures. The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets. Computational experiments on Syngas and GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanisms demonstrate that our framework achieves high fidelity in predicting complex kinetic behavior using only the initial conditions of the state variables.",

      "summary": "In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.",

This extended formulation is particularly useful in image-based visual servoing scenarios where stable bearing estimates are required and the relative velocity between the vehicle and target features must be accounted for. Leveraging lifted kinematics to the Special Orthogonal group, we design an observer for the bearing vector and prove its almost global asymptotic stability. Additionally, we demonstrate how the equivariant observer can be expressed in the original state manifold. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

      "summary": "Message-passing algorithms have been adapted for compressive imaging by incorporating various off-the-shelf image denoisers. However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.",

      "summary": "To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.",

We introduce a Dual-Axis Representation-Complete Convergent Learning (RCCL) strategy, enabled by a molecular representation that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) encoding of local valence environments, grounded in modern valence bond theory, together with no-bridge graph (NBG) encoding of ring/cage topologies, providing a quantitative measure of chemical-space coverage. This framework formalizes representation completeness, establishing a principled basis for constructing datasets that support convergent learning for large models. Guided by this RCCL framework, we develop the FD25 dataset, systematically covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies, achieving near-complete combinatorial coverage of organic molecules with H/C/N/O/F elements. Graph neural networks trained on FD25 exhibit representation-complete convergent learning and strong out-of-distribution generalization, with an overall prediction error of approximately 1.0 kcal/mol MAE across external benchmarks. Our results establish a quantitative link between molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, providing a foundation for interpretable, transferable, and data-efficient molecular intelligence.",

      "summary": "Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created",

Therefore, this paper proposes GRAFT (GRid-Aware Forecasting with Text), which modifies and improves STanHOP to better support grid-aware forecasting and multi-source textual interventions. Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting.",

The wing shapes in the dataset are generated using a simplified yet expressive geometry parameterization that incorporates spanwise variations in airfoil shape, twist, and dihedral, allowing for an enhanced diversity without relying on perturbations of a baseline wing. All shapes are simulated under a broad range of Mach numbers and angles of attack covering the typical flight envelope. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we benchmark two state-of-the-art Transformers that accurately predict surface flow and achieve a 2.5 drag-count error on held-out samples. Models pretrained on SuperWing further exhibit strong zero-shot generalization to complex benchmark wings such as DLR-F6 and NASA CRM, underscoring the dataset's diversity and potential for practical usage.",

This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics.",

This paper presents TiCard, a low intrusion, correction-based framework that augments (rather than replaces) a database's native estimator. TiCard learns multiplicative residual corrections using EXPLAIN-only features, and uses EXPLAIN ANALYZE only for offline labels. We study two practical instantiations: (i) a Gradient Boosting Regressor for sub-millisecond inference, and (ii) TabPFN, an in-context tabular foundation model that adapts by refreshing a small reference set without gradient retraining. On TiDB with TPCH and the Join Order Benchmark, in a low-trace setting (263 executions total; 157 used for learning), TiCard improves operator-level tail accuracy substantially: P90 Q-error drops from 312.85 (native) to 13.69 (TiCard-GBR), and P99 drops from 37,974.37 to 3,416.50 (TiCard-TabPFN), while a join-only policy preserves near-perfect median behavior.

      "summary": "Comprehensive environment perception is essential for autonomous vehicles to operate safely. It is crucial to detect both dynamic road users and static objects like traffic signs or lanes as these are required for safe motion planning. However, in many circumstances a complete perception of other objects or lanes is not achievable due to limited sensor ranges, occlusions, and curves. In scenarios where an accurate localization is not possible or for roads where no HD maps are available, an autonomous vehicle must rely solely on its perceived road information. Thus, extending local sensing capabilities through collective perception using vehicle-to-vehicle communication is a promising strategy that has not yet been explored for lane detection. Therefore, we propose a real-time capable approach for collective perception of lanes using a spline-based estimation of undetected road sections. We evaluate our proposed fusion algorithm in various situations and road types. We were able to achieve real-time capability and extend the perception range by up to 200%.",

The proposed model emerges from a change of coordinates from canonical Hamiltonian dynamics, and splits the standard Hamiltonian momentum variable into a task-space momentum variable and a null-space momentum variable.

      "summary": "Recent approaches employing imperceptible perturbations in input images have demonstrated promising potential to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.",

We study this phenomenon in classical Hopfield networks and show they can infer the full isomorphism class of a graph from a small random sample. Our results reveal that: (i) graph isomorphism classes can be represented within a three-dimensional invariant subspace, (ii) using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF) has an implicit bias toward norm-efficient solutions, which underpins a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning isomorphism classes, and (iii) across multiple learning rules, parameters converge toward the invariant subspace as sample sizes grow. Together, these findings highlight a unifying mechanism for generalization in Hopfield networks: a bias toward norm efficiency in learning drives the emergence of approximate invariance under group-structured data.",

While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

However, a growing body of studies show that LRMs are still inefficient, over-generating verification and reflection steps. To address this challenge, we introduce the Step-Tagging framework, a lightweight sentence-classifier enabling real-time annotation of the type of reasoning steps that an LRM is generating. To monitor reasoning behaviors, we introduced ReasonType: a novel taxonomy of reasoning steps. Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro). We achieve 20 to 50\\% token reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard generation, with largest gains observed on more computation-heavy tasks. This work offers a novel way to increase control over the generation of LRMs, and a new tool to study behaviors of LRMs.",

We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.",

      "summary": "The efficiency of water electrolysis in a photoelectrochemical cell is largely limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at its semiconductor photoanode. Reaction rate constants are key to investigating the slow kinetics of the multistep OER, as they indicate the rate-determining step. While these rate constants are usually calculated based on first-principles simulations, this research aims to estimate them from experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data. Starting from a microkinetic model for charge transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, an expression for the impedance as a function of the rate constants is derived. At lower potentials, the order of this impedance model is reduced, thus eliminating the rate constants corresponding to the last reaction steps. Moreover, it is shown that EIS data from at least two potentials needs to be combined in order to uniquely identify the rate constants of a particular reduced order model. Therefore, this work details a sample maximum likelihood estimator that integrates not only multiple frequencies, but also multiple potentials simultaneously. Measuring multiple periods of the current density and potential signals, allows this frequency domain estimator to take measurement uncertainty into account. In addition, due to the large numerical range of the rate constants, various scaling methods are implemented to achieve numerical stability. To find suitable initial values for the highly nonlinear optimization problem, different global estimation methods are compared. The complete estimation procedure of the rate constants is illustrated on simulated EIS data of a hematite photoanode.",

In health-related contexts, following or rejecting AI-generated advice can have direct clinical implications. Existing instruments like the Trust in Automated Systems Survey assess trustworthiness of generic technology, and no validated instrument measures users' trust in AI-generated health advice specifically. This study developed and validated the Trust in AI-Generated Health Advice (TAIGHA) scale and its four-item short form (TAIGHA-S) as theory-based instruments measuring trust and distrust, each with cognitive and affective components. The items were developed using a generative AI approach, followed by content validation with 10 domain experts, face validation with 30 lay participants, and psychometric validation with 385 UK participants who received AI-generated advice in a symptom-assessment scenario. After automated item reduction, 28 items were retained and reduced to 10 based on expert ratings. TAIGHA showed excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave=0.99) and CFA confirmed a two-factor model with excellent fit (CFI=0.98, TLI=0.98, RMSEA=0.07, SRMR=0.03). Internal consistency was high (α=0.95). Convergent validity was supported by correlations with the Trust in Automated Systems Survey (r=0.67/-0.66) and users' reliance on the AI's advice (r=0.37 for trust), while divergent validity was supported by low correlations with reading flow and mental load (all |r|<0.25). TAIGHA-S correlated highly with the full scale (r=0.96) and showed good reliability (α=0.88). TAIGHA and TAIGHA-S are validated instruments for assessing user trust and distrust in AI-generated health advice. Reporting trust and distrust separately permits a more complete evaluation of AI interventions, and the short scale is well-suited for time-constrained settings.",

      "summary": "The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications. One such application deployed over real-world decentralized knowledge graphs can be found at https://www.expasy.org/chat.",

Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.",

      "summary": "Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.",

Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.",

However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data. UAE achieves multimodal sensor decoding through volume rendering, enabling accurate and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we incorporate a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a ControlNet branch to enable controllable multimodal sensor generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OminiGen achieves desired performances in unified multimodal sensor data generation with multimodal consistency and flexible sensor adjustments.",

While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.",

Herein, random-bridges can act as stochastic transports between two probability distributions when appropriately initialized, and can display either Markovian or non-Markovian, and either continuous, discontinuous or hybrid patterns depending on the driving process. We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing. Our empirical results, built on Gaussian random bridges, produce high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps compared to traditional approaches, while achieving competitive Frechet inception distance scores. Our analysis provides evidence that the proposed framework is computationally cheap and suitable for high-speed generation tasks.",

Among various optimization-based attacks, the gradient-based PGD and the momentum-based MI-FGSM have garnered considerable interest. However, all these attacks use the sign function to scale their perturbations, which raises several theoretical concerns from the point of view of optimization. In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad. Motivated by this analysis, we present a novel momentum-based attack AdaMI, in which the perturbation is optimized with an interesting momentum-based adaptive matrix. AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed momentum-based adaptive matrix can serve as a general and effective technique to boost adversarial transferability over the state-of-the-art methods across different networks while maintaining better stability and imperceptibility.",

A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders. Moreover, domain experts used XQAI-Eyes to derive two key practices for quantum encoder selection, grounded in the principles of pattern preservation and feature mapping.",

Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.",

Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.",

We present KalMRACO, a unification of the Kalman filter and MRAC leveraging the reference model of MRAC as the Kalman filter system model, thus eliminating, to a large degree, the need for knowledge of the underlying system parameters in the application of the Kalman filter.

      "summary": "Recent approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) have achieved leading performance by directly regressing 3D poses from 2D keypoint sequences. Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.",

      "summary": "High renewable penetration has significantly reduced system inertia in modern power grids, increasing the need for fast frequency response (FFR) from distributed and non-traditional resources. While electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) have each demonstrated the capability to provide sub-second active power support, their combined frequency response potential has not been systematically evaluated. This paper proposes a coordinated control framework that aggregates these heterogeneous resources to provide fast, stable, and reliable FFR. Dynamic models for EV fleets, data center UPS and workload modulation, and BESS are developed, explicitly capturing their response times, power limits, and operational constraints. A hierarchical control architecture is introduced, where an upper-level coordinator dynamically allocates FFR among resources based on response speed and available capacity, and lower-level controllers implement the actual power response. Case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the coordinated EV-DC-BESS framework improves frequency nadir by up to 0.2 Hz, reduces RoCoF, and accelerates frequency recovery compared with single-resource FFR. Results confirm that synergistic coordination significantly enhances grid stability, especially in low-inertia scenarios. This work highlights the value of multi-resource aggregation for future frequency regulation markets in renewable-dominated grids.",

Previous work either infers intent statically, e.g., permission-centric, or widget-level or monitors coarse dynamic signals (endpoints, partial resource usage) that miss content and context. UIXPOSE infers an intent vector from each screen using vision-language models and knowledge structures and combines decoded network payloads, heap/memory signals, and resource utilisation traces into a behaviour vector. Their alignment, calculated at runtime, can both detect misbehaviour and highlight exploration of behaviourally rich paths. In three real-world case studies, UIXPOSE reveals covert exfiltration and hidden background activity that evade metadata-only baselines, demonstrating how IBA improves dynamic detection.",

This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging data centers for providing fast frequency response through real-time workload modulation and UPS coordination. A dynamic model combining data center power consumption and grid frequency dynamics is developed, capturing the interactions between IT servers, cooling systems, and energy storage. Control strategies based on frequency deviation are implemented to adjust server power and discharge UPS batteries during frequency events.

Recent advances of Large Language Models (LMMs) and motion analysis techniques provide new opportunities to address the above limitations. In this paper, we propose SportsGPT, an LLM-driven framework for interpretable sports motion assessment and training guidance, which establishes a closed loop from motion time-series input to professional training guidance. First, given a set of high-quality target models, we introduce MotionDTW, a two-stage time series alignment algorithm designed for accurate keyframe extraction from skeleton-based motion sequences. Subsequently, we design a Knowledge-based Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment Model (KISMAM) to obtain a set of interpretable assessment metrics (e.g., insufficient extension) by constrasting the keyframes with the targe models. Finally, we propose SportsRAG, a RAG-based training guidance model based on Qwen3. Leveraging a 6B-token knowledge base, it prompts the LLM to generate professional training guidance by retrieving domain-specific QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error and higher IoU scores. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the KISMAM and SportsRAG, confirming that SportsGPT surpasses general LLMs in diagnostic accuracy and professionalism.",

Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.",

To address these shortcomings, we propose a joint multimodal contrastive learning framework that unifies both acoustic and cross-modal supervision in a shared embedding space. Our approach simultaneously optimizes: (i) audio-text contrastive learning, inspired by the CLAP loss, to align audio and text representations and (ii) audio-audio contrastive learning, via Deep Word Discrimination (DWD) loss, to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. The proposed method outperforms existing AWE baselines on word discrimination task while flexibly supporting both STD and KWS.

An efficient algorithm constructs CSEF from established metrics with joint-wise weighting and task conditioning, and we integrate it into a gradient-based planner compatible with impedance-controlled robots. In a 2-DoF benchmark, CSEF-based planning achieves higher success rates, lower ergonomic cost, and faster computation than a task-space ergonomic planner. Hardware experiments with a dual-arm robot in unimanual guidance, collaborative drilling, and bimanual cocarrying show faster ergonomic cost reduction, closer tracking to optimized joint targets, and lower muscle activation than a point-to-point baseline. CSEF-based planning method reduces average ergonomic scores by up to 10.31% for collaborative drilling tasks and 5.60% for bimanual co-carrying tasks while decreasing activation in key muscle groups, indicating practical benefits for real-world deployment.",

We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.",

However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.",

      "summary": "Video-based respiratory rate (RR) estimation is often unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality across extraction methods. We present a predictive, quality-aware framework that integrates heterogeneous signal sources with dynamic assessment of reliability. Ten signals are extracted from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, and analyzed using four spectral estimators: Welch's method, Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and peak detection. Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal. This enables adaptive signal fusion and quality-based segment filtering. Experiments on three public datasets (OMuSense-23, COHFACE, MAHNOB-HCI) show that the proposed framework achieves lower RR estimation errors than individual methods in most cases, with performance gains depending on dataset characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of quality-driven predictive modeling to deliver scalable and generalizable video-based respiratory monitoring solutions.",

      "summary": "The practical deployment of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems is fundamentally challenged by significant performance degradation in real-world environments, characterized by unpredictable acoustic noise and visual interference. This dissertation posits that a systematic, hierarchical approach is essential to overcome these challenges, achieving the robust scalability at the representation, architecture, and system levels. At the representation level, we investigate methods for building a unified model that learns audio-visual features inherently robust to diverse real-world corruptions, thereby enabling generalization to new environments without specialized modules. To address architectural scalability, we explore how to efficiently expand model capacity while ensuring the adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, developing a framework that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the input characteristics. Finally, at the system level, we present methods to expand the system's functionality through modular integration with large-scale foundation models, leveraging their powerful cognitive and generative capabilities to maximize final recognition accuracy. By systematically providing solutions at each of these three levels, this dissertation aims to build a next-generation, robust, and scalable AVSR system with high reliability in real-world applications.",

      "summary": "Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as the de facto architecture for scaling up language models without significantly increasing the computational cost. Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.",

      "summary": "Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.",

To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution. First, we propose an LQ-guided feature modulation module that leverages original uncompressed information from LQ inputs to provide high-fidelity conditioning for the diffusion process. We then develop a region-adaptive generative prior activation method to effectively enhance perceptual richness without sacrificing local structural fidelity. Finally, we employ a text-matching guidance strategy to fully harness the conditioning potential of text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CODSR achieves superior perceptual quality and competitive fidelity compared with state-of-the-art methods with efficient one-step inference.",

Most existing studies on indoor daylight predictions were developed and tested for static scenes. This study proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts indoor workplane illuminance distributions in real time from non-intrusive images with temporal-spatial features. By extracting image features only from the side-lit window areas rather than interior pixels, the approach remains applicable in dynamically occupied indoor spaces. A field experiment was conducted in a test room in Guangzhou (China), where 17,344 samples were collected for model training and validation. The model achieved R2 > 0.98 with RMSE < 0.14 on the same-distribution test set and R2 > 0.82 with RMSE < 0.17 on an unseen-day test set, indicating high accuracy and acceptable temporal generalization.",

      "summary": "Talking face editing and face generation have often been studied as distinct problems. In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.",

      "summary": "A function inlining optimization is a widely used transformation in modern compilers, which replaces a call site with the callee's body in need. While this transformation improves performance, it significantly impacts static features such as machine instructions and control flow graphs, which are crucial to binary analysis. Yet, despite its broad impact, the security impact of function inlining remains underexplored to date. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of function inlining through the lens of machine learning-based binary analysis. To this end, we dissect the inlining decision pipeline within the LLVM's cost model and explore the combinations of the compiler options that aggressively promote the function inlining ratio beyond standard optimization levels, which we term extreme inlining. We focus on five ML-assisted binary analysis tasks for security, using 20 unique models to systematically evaluate their robustness under extreme inlining scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal several significant findings: i) function inlining, though a benign transformation in intent, can (in)directly affect ML model behaviors, being potentially exploited by evading discriminative or generative ML models; ii) ML models relying on static features can be highly sensitive to inlining; iii) subtle compiler settings can be leveraged to deliberately craft evasive binary variants; and iv) inlining ratios vary substantially across applications and build configurations, undermining assumptions of consistency in training and evaluation of ML models.",

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.",

      "summary": "Cancer progression arises from interactions across multiple biological layers, especially beyond morphological and across molecular layers that remain invisible to image-only models. To capture this broader biological landscape, we present EXAONE Path 2.5, a pathology foundation model that jointly models histologic, genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic modalities, producing an integrated patient representation that reflects tumor biology more comprehensively. Our approach incorporates three key components: (1) multimodal SigLIP loss enabling all-pairwise contrastive learning across heterogeneous modalities, (2) a fragment-aware rotary positional encoding (F-RoPE) module that preserves spatial structure and tissue-fragment topology in WSI, and (3) domain-specialized internal foundation models for both WSI and RNA-seq to provide biologically grounded embeddings for robust multimodal alignment. We evaluate EXAONE Path 2.5 against six leading pathology foundation models across two complementary benchmarks: an internal real-world clinical dataset and the Patho-Bench benchmark covering 80 tasks. Our framework demonstrates high data and parameter efficiency, achieving on-par performance with state-of-the-art foundation models on Patho-Bench while exhibiting the highest adaptability in the internal clinical setting. These results highlight the value of biologically informed multimodal design and underscore the potential of integrated genotype-to-phenotype modeling for next-generation precision oncology.",

      "summary": "We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/NEC-VID/KFS-Bench.",

      "summary": "Antigenic epitope presented by major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) proteins plays an essential role in immunotherapy. However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework. Overall, this work serves as a valuable resource for advancing computational immunotherapy, providing a foundation for future research in ML guided epitope discovery and predictive modeling of immune responses.",

      "summary": "Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image understanding, generation, and editing. However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling. To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.",

Given the initial guess and pairs of images and LiDAR point clouds, CLAIM utilizes a coarse-to-fine searching method to find the optimal transformation minimizing a patched Pearson correlation-based structure loss and a mutual information-based texture loss. These two losses serve as good metrics for camera-LiDAR alignment results and require no complicated steps of data processing, feature extraction, or feature matching like most methods, rendering our method simple and adaptive to most scenes. We validate CLAIM on public KITTI, Waymo, and MIAS-LCEC datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
