      "summary": "This study evaluates two leading approaches for teaching construction robots new skills to understand their applicability for construction automation: a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. The goal is to understand both task performance and the practical effort needed to deploy each approach on real jobs. The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload. Overall, the findings indicate that VLA offers practical advantages for changing tasks by reducing programming effort and enabling useful performance with minimal data, while DQN provides a viable baseline when sufficient tuning effort is acceptable.",

      "summary": "End-to-end autonomous driving systems based on vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate multimodal sensor inputs and language instructions to generate planning and control signals. While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

      "summary": "Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.",

      "summary": "Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.",

      "summary": "Despite significant progress in text-driven 4D human-object interaction (HOI) generation with supervised methods, the scalability remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.",

We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of reference signals.

Given a collection of multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details. We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.",

      "summary": "We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.",

      "summary": "We introduce CRISP, a method that recovers simulatable human motion and scene geometry from monocular video. Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\\% to 6.9\\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos. This demonstrates CRISP's ability to generate physically-valid human motion and interaction environments at scale, greatly advancing real-to-sim applications for robotics and AR/VR.",

      "summary": "Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.",

      "summary": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.",

      "summary": "We introduce MoLingo, a text-to-motion (T2M) model that generates realistic, lifelike human motion by denoising in a continuous latent space. Recent works perform latent space diffusion, either on the whole latent at once or auto-regressively over multiple latents. In this paper, we study how to make diffusion on continuous motion latents work best. We focus on two questions: (1) how to build a semantically aligned latent space so diffusion becomes more effective, and (2) how to best inject text conditioning so the motion follows the description closely. We propose a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels so that latents with similar text meaning stay close, which makes the latent space more diffusion-friendly. We also compare single-token conditioning with a multi-token cross-attention scheme and find that cross-attention gives better motion realism and text-motion alignment. With semantically aligned latents, auto-regressive generation, and cross-attention text conditioning, our model sets a new state of the art in human motion generation on standard metrics and in a user study. We will release our code and models for further research and downstream usage.",

      "summary": "We present GASPACHO, a method for generating photorealistic, controllable renderings of human-object interactions from multi-view RGB video. Unlike prior work that reconstructs only the human and treats objects as background, GASPACHO simultaneously recovers animatable templates for both the human and the interacting object as distinct sets of Gaussians, thereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions in different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. We introduce a novel formulation that learns object Gaussians on an underlying 2D surface manifold rather than in 3D volume, yielding sharper, fine-grained object details for dynamic object reconstruction. We further propose a contact constraint in Gaussian space that regularizes human-object relations and enables natural, physically plausible animation. Across three benchmarks - BEHAVE, NeuralDome, and DNA-Rendering - GASPACHO achieves high-quality reconstructions under heavy occlusion and supports controllable synthesis of novel human-object interactions. We also demonstrate that our method allows for composition of humans and objects in 3D scenes and for the first time showcase that neural rendering can be used for the controllable generation of photoreal humans interacting with dynamic objects in diverse scenes.

      "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has driven major advances in computational pathology by enabling the learning of rich representations from histopathology data. Yet, tissue analysis alone may fall short in capturing broader molecular complexity, as key complementary information resides in high-dimensional omics profiles such as transcriptomics, methylomics, and genomics. To address this gap, we introduce MORPHEUS, the first multimodal pre-training strategy that integrates histopathology images and multi-omics data within a shared transformer-based architecture. At its core, MORPHEUS relies on a novel masked omics modeling objective that encourages the model to learn meaningful cross-modal relationships. This yields a general-purpose pre-trained encoder that can be applied to histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities. Beyond inference, MORPHEUS also supports flexible any-to-any omics reconstruction, enabling one or more omics profiles to be reconstructed from any modality subset that includes histopathology. Pre-trained on a large pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS shows substantial improvements over supervised and SSL baselines across diverse tasks and modality combinations. Together, these capabilities position it as a promising direction for the development of multimodal foundation models in oncology. Code is publicly available atthis https URL",

      "summary": "We present a method for jointly recovering the appearance and internal structure of botanical plants from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance. Experiments show that the GaussianPlant achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling the extraction of branch structure and leaf instances.",

      "summary": "The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of \"Long-Tail\" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a \"System 2\" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model \"Judge-Scout\" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40% ccompared to the best single scout models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.",

WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique challenges of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D, together with the instruction-tuning dataset EgoIT, which is collected from multiple sources to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities. Building upon the datasets, we propose a migration strategy and further design a progressive mapping learning pipeline with three stages: Demonstrator Self-Preparation, Demonstrator-Learner Guidance, and Learner Self-Practice. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.",

Filtering using a trained model (i.e., teacher-based filtering) has emerged as a successful solution, leveraging a pre-trained model to compute quality scores. To explain the empirical success of teacher-based filtering, we characterize the performance of filtered contrastive learning under the standard bimodal data generation model. Denoting $\\eta\\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\\frac{1}{\\eta \\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\eta n}}$ in the large $\\eta$ regime, and by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $\\eta$ regime.",

This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini. Many chain of thought reasoning models such as R1-Onevision and LLaVA-CoT struggle to outperform even a random baseline in agent-agent collaboration, indicating a potential growth area in their communication abilities.",

      "summary": "With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities on vision-language tasks. In the biomedical domain, however, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic Medical Decision Making (MDM) tasks. We investigate this limitation using two challenging datasets: (1) three-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), where category differences are visually subtle, and (2) MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification with 14 non-mutually exclusive conditions. Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. To mitigate this, we explore three strategies: (1) in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, (2) vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and (3) few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision. These findings reveal that current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding and point to promising directions for improving multimodal decision making in healthcare.",

      "summary": "Teleoperation presents a promising paradigm for remote control and robot proprioceptive data collection. Despite recent progress, current teleoperation systems still suffer from limitations in efficiency and ergonomics, particularly in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose CaFe-TeleVision, a coarse-to-fine teleoperation system with immersive situated visualization for enhanced ergonomics. At its core, a coarse-to-fine control mechanism is proposed in the retargeting module to bridge workspace disparities, jointly optimizing efficiency and physical ergonomics. To stream immersive feedback with adequate visual cues for human vision systems, an on-demand situated visualization technique is integrated in the perception module, which reduces the cognitive load for multi-view processing. The system is built on a humanoid collaborative robot and validated with six challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. User study among 24 participants confirms that CaFe-TeleVision enhances ergonomics with statistical significance, indicating a lower task load and a higher user acceptance during teleoperation. Quantitative results also validate the superior performance of our system across six tasks, surpassing comparative methods by up to 28.89% in success rate and accelerating by 26.81% in completion time.

However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.",

Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.",

This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT)this http URLexisting multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localizationthis http URLwe introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and \"zoom in\" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward. This reward not only eliminates the need for dense labels but also circumvents the instability of external tool calls by enforcing real-time cross-modal consistency between the visual focus and the textual reasoning. Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 demonstrate our model's significant improvements. Compared to the baseline Qwen2.5VL-7B, OmniDrive-R1 improves the overall reasoning score from 51.77% to 80.35%, and the final answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62%.",

Due to the inherent complexity of the real world, existing models have predominantly been developed and limited to be task-specific. We introduce UNITE, a Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D scene understanding, a novel feed-forward neural network that unifies a diverse set of 3D semantic tasks within a single model. Our model operates on unseen scenes in a fully end-to-end manner and only takes a few seconds to infer the full 3D semantic geometry. Our approach is capable of directly predicting multiple semantic attributes, including 3D scene segmentation, instance embeddings, open-vocabulary features, as well as affordance and articulations, solely from RGB images. The method is trained using a combination of 2D distillation, heavily relying on self-supervision and leverages novel multi-view losses designed to ensure 3D view consistency. We demonstrate that UNITE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several different semantic tasks and even outperforms task-specific models, in many cases, surpassing methods that operate on ground truth 3D geometry.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.",

      "summary": "The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area.",

      "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, the challenge of securing them against adversarial \"jailbreaking\" attacks has intensified. Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism. These findings demonstrate that Semantic Turbulence serves not only as a lightweight, real-time jailbreak detector but also as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for categorizing the underlying safety architecture of black-box models.",

      "summary": "Cancer progression arises from interactions across multiple biological layers, especially beyond morphological and across molecular layers that remain invisible to image-only models. To capture this broader biological landscape, we present EXAONE Path 2.5, a pathology foundation model that jointly models histologic, genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic modalities, producing an integrated patient representation that reflects tumor biology more comprehensively. Our approach incorporates three key components: (1) multimodal SigLIP loss enabling all-pairwise contrastive learning across heterogeneous modalities, (2) a fragment-aware rotary positional encoding (F-RoPE) module that preserves spatial structure and tissue-fragment topology in WSI, and (3) domain-specialized internal foundation models for both WSI and RNA-seq to provide biologically grounded embeddings for robust multimodal alignment. We evaluate EXAONE Path 2.5 against six leading pathology foundation models across two complementary benchmarks: an internal real-world clinical dataset and the Patho-Bench benchmark covering 80 tasks. Our framework demonstrates high data and parameter efficiency, achieving on-par performance with state-of-the-art foundation models on Patho-Bench while exhibiting the highest adaptability in the internal clinical setting. These results highlight the value of biologically informed multimodal design and underscore the potential of integrated genotype-to-phenotype modeling for next-generation precision oncology.",

However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

To address these shortcomings, we propose a joint multimodal contrastive learning framework that unifies both acoustic and cross-modal supervision in a shared embedding space. Our approach simultaneously optimizes: (i) audio-text contrastive learning, inspired by the CLAP loss, to align audio and text representations and (ii) audio-audio contrastive learning, via Deep Word Discrimination (DWD) loss, to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. The proposed method outperforms existing AWE baselines on word discrimination task while flexibly supporting both STD and KWS.

      "summary": "Aligning large language models with human preferences is essential for improving interaction quality and safety by ensuring outputs better reflect human values. A promising strategy involves Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), starting with collecting and ranking responses generated by a supervised fine-tuning model to refine alignment. Existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) focus on pairwise comparisons, categorizing responses into preferred and less preferred pairs and optimizing pairwise margins. However, this pairwise approach cannot capture the holistic ranking relationships among multiple responses or effectively leverage the rich preference information available in list-wise comparisons. To address this challenge, this paper introduces \\underline{D}irect \\underline{R}anking \\underline{P}reference \\underline{O}ptimization (DRPO), a novel method that views human preference alignment as a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) task. Unlike pairwise methods, DRPO optimizes the preference ranking of entire response lists by computing holistic utility scores through NDCG, a standard LTR metric. To enable end-to-end optimization with the non-differentiable NDCG, we propose diffNDCG loss, a differentiable approximation facilitated by a sorting network. Furthermore, we introduce a novel margin-based Adaptive Rank Policy Score to enhance the discriminative quality of generated responses. Extensive experiments have shown that DRPO outperforms existing methods, enhancing the quality of the generated responses.",

We introduce a birefringent metalens -- a planar nanophotonic lens composed of subwavelength pixels for wavefront shaping with a thickness of 700 nm and a diameter of 3 mm -- to physically prompt depth foundation models. In a single monocular shot, our metalens physically embeds depth information into two polarized optical wavefronts, which we decode through a lightweight prompting and fine-tuning framework that aligns depth foundation models with the optical signals. To scale the training data, we develop a light wave propagation simulator that synthesizes metalens responses from RGB-D datasets, incorporating key physical factors to minimize the sim-to-real gap. Simulated and physical experiments with our fabricated titanium-dioxide metalens demonstrate accurate and consistent metric depth over state-of-the-art monocular depth estimators. The research demonstrates that nanophotonic wavefront formation offers a promising bridge for grounding depth foundation models in physical depth sensing.",

To effectively enhance generative performance while preserving existing comprehension capabilities, we introduce STAR: a STacked AutoRegressive scheme for task-progressive unified multimodal learning. This approach decomposes multimodal learning into multiple stages: understanding, generation, and editing. By freezing the parameters of the fundamental autoregressive (AR) model and progressively stacking isomorphic AR modules, it avoids cross-task interference while expanding the model's capabilities. Concurrently, we introduce a high-capacity VQ to enhance the granularity of image representations and employ an implicit reasoning mechanism to improve generation quality under complex conditions. Experiments demonstrate that STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34), validating its efficacy for unified multimodal learning.",

      "summary": "Multi-view image generation from a single image and text description remains challenging due to the difficulty of maintaining geometric consistency across different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures. Our approach demonstrates that discrete diffusion provides a viable and simple alternative to existing multi-view generation methods, ranking first on average across GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while maintaining architectural simplicity.",

      "summary": "Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.",

      "summary": "Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

      "summary": "Multimodal remote sensing data, acquired from diverse sensors, offer a comprehensive and integrated perspective of the Earth's surface. Leveraging multimodal fusion techniques, semantic segmentation enables detailed and accurate analysis of geographic scenes, surpassing single-modality approaches. Building on advancements in vision foundation models, particularly the Segment Anything Model (SAM), this study proposes a unified framework incorporating a novel Multimodal Fine-tuning Network (MFNet) for remote sensing semantic segmentation. The proposed framework is designed to seamlessly integrate with various fine-tuning mechanisms, demonstrated through the inclusion of Adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as representative examples. This extensibility ensures the framework's adaptability to other emerging fine-tuning strategies, allowing models to retain SAM's general knowledge while effectively leveraging multimodal data. Additionally, a pyramid-based Deep Fusion Module (DFM) is introduced to integrate high-level geographic features across multiple scales, enhancing feature representation prior to decoding. This work also highlights SAM's robust generalization capabilities with Digital Surface Model (DSM) data, a novel application. Extensive experiments on three benchmark multimodal remote sensing datasets, ISPRS Vaihingen, ISPRS Potsdam and MMHunan, demonstrate that the proposed MFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in multimodal semantic segmentation, setting a new standard in the field while offering a versatile foundation for future research and applications.

      "summary": "Transferring 2D textures to 3D modalities is of great significance for improving the efficiency of multimedia content creation. Existing approaches have rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D style transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to 3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of the scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture transfer results. In this paper, we present GT^2-GS, a geometry-aware texture transfer framework for gaussian splitting. From the perspective of matching texture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the issue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture augmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a geometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into the scene representation. This loss function incorporates both camera pose and 3D geometric information of the scene, enabling controllable texture-oriented appearance editing. Finally, a geometry preservation strategy is introduced. By alternating between the texture transfer and geometry correction stages over multiple iterations, this strategy achieves a balance between learning texture features and preserving geometric integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our method. Through geometric awareness, our approach achieves texture transfer results that better align with human visual perception. Our homepage is available atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.",

      "summary": "Stroke is a major public health problem, affecting millions worldwide. Deep learning has recently demonstrated promise for enhancing the diagnosis and risk prediction of stroke. However, existing methods rely on costly medical imaging modalities, such as computed tomography. Recent studies suggest that retinal imaging could offer a cost-effective alternative for cerebrovascular health assessment due to the shared clinical pathways between the retina and the brain. Hence, this study explores the impact of leveraging retinal images and clinical data for stroke detection and risk prediction. We propose a multimodal deep neural network that processes Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared reflectance retinal scans, combined with clinical data, such as demographics, vital signs, and diagnosis codes. We pretrained our model using a self-supervised learning framework using a real-world dataset consisting of $37$ k scans, and then fine-tuned and evaluated the model using a smaller labeled subset. Our empirical findings establish the predictive ability of the considered modalities in detecting lasting effects in the retina associated with acute stroke and forecasting future risk within a specific time horizon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by achieving $5$\\% AUROC improvement as compared to the unimodal image-only baseline, and $8$\\% improvement compared to an existing state-of-the-art foundation model. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of retinal imaging in identifying high-risk patients and improving long-term outcomes.",

      "summary": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a key methodology for accelerating molecular discovery by estimating the mapping from molecules to their properties while seeking the optimal candidate. Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery.",

Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving.Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.",

We introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework where large language models autonomously design, execute, and interpret atomistic simulations. In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M-N-C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias. Altogether, multi-agent collaboration accelerates materials discovery and marks a new paradigm for autonomous scientific exploration.",

      "summary": "LLM implementations are failing in highly regulated industries owing to instability issues, inconsistent reasoning, hallucinations and performance variability, especially in workflows. These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).",

      "summary": "Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures effectively scale model capacity by activating only a subset of experts for each input token. However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.",

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.",

HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.",

      "summary": "Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.",

      "summary": "Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with \"LogitMap Pairs\" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.",

While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence, across 41 large language models and 7 challenging benchmarks, showing that scaling single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.",

To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.",

      "summary": "Ride-hailing platforms face the challenge of balancing passenger waiting times with overall system efficiency under highly uncertain supply-demand conditions. Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns.We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies.With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.",

      "summary": "The performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents depends critically on the quality of the underlying feature representations. Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincaré Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%. On Atari-5 with Double DQN, Hyper++ strongly outperforms Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines. We release our code atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "Recently, offline reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular RL paradigm. In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged.To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository.",

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation.",

      "summary": "Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for clinical research requires a comprehensive data foundation that supports model training and rigorous evaluation. Here, we introduce TrialPanorama, a large-scale structured resource that aggregates 1.6M clinical trial records from fifteen global registries and links them with biomedical ontologies and associated literature. To demonstrate its utility, we build a pipeline that constructs 152K training and testing samples for eight key clinical research tasks. Three tasks support systematic review workflows, including study search, study screening, and evidence summarization. Five tasks focus on trial design and optimization, including arm design, eligibility criteria design, endpoint selection, sample size estimation, and trial completion assessment and rationalization. Benchmarking cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) reveals that generic LLMs have limited capability in clinical reasoning. In contrast, an 8B LLM we developed on TrialPanorama using supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning wins over the 70B generic counterparts in all eight tasks, with a relative improvement of 73.7%, 67.6%, 38.4%, 37.8%, 26.5%, 20.7%, 20.0%, 18.1%, and 5.2%, respectively. We envision that TrialPanorama provides a solid foundation for future scaling of AI for clinical research.",

      "summary": "Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut, SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses: Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.",

We propose the Configuration Space Ergonomic Field (CSEF), a continuous and differentiable field over the human joint space that quantifies ergonomic quality and provides gradients for real-time ergonomics-aware planning. An efficient algorithm constructs CSEF from established metrics with joint-wise weighting and task conditioning, and we integrate it into a gradient-based planner compatible with impedance-controlled robots. In a 2-DoF benchmark, CSEF-based planning achieves higher success rates, lower ergonomic cost, and faster computation than a task-space ergonomic planner. Hardware experiments with a dual-arm robot in unimanual guidance, collaborative drilling, and bimanual cocarrying show faster ergonomic cost reduction, closer tracking to optimized joint targets, and lower muscle activation than a point-to-point baseline. CSEF-based planning method reduces average ergonomic scores by up to 10.31% for collaborative drilling tasks and 5.60% for bimanual co-carrying tasks while decreasing activation in key muscle groups, indicating practical benefits for real-world deployment.",

Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, our approach disentangles visibility from persistent object identity by modeling each space-time point with an occupancy probability and a conditional instance distribution. To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.",

ExpanDyNeRF optimizes density and color features to improve scene reconstruction from challenging perspectives.

By generating large volumes of high-fidelity simulated scenarios and pairing them with automated labeling and model training, the pipeline enables rapid iteration on perception, navigation, and decision-making capabilities without the cost, risk, or time constraints of extensive field trials. The resulting datasets can be tuned quickly for new operational environments and threat conditions, supporting both baseline humanoid performance and advanced subsystems such as multimodal sensing, counter-detection survivability, and CBRNE-relevant reconnaissance behaviors.

      "summary": "Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA. MMDrive effectively breaks the traditional image-only understanding barrier, enabling robust multimodal reasoning in complex driving environments and providing a new foundation for interpretable autonomous driving scene understanding.",

Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems. The complete source code and datasets used in this study are available atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "Daylight-linked controls (DLCs) have significant potential for energy savings in buildings, especially when abundant daylight is available and indoor workplane illuminance can be accurately predicted in real time. Most existing studies on indoor daylight predictions were developed and tested for static scenes. This study proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts indoor workplane illuminance distributions in real time from non-intrusive images with temporal-spatial features. By extracting image features only from the side-lit window areas rather than interior pixels, the approach remains applicable in dynamically occupied indoor spaces. A field experiment was conducted in a test room in Guangzhou (China), where 17,344 samples were collected for model training and validation. The model achieved R2 > 0.98 with RMSE < 0.14 on the same-distribution test set and R2 > 0.82 with RMSE < 0.17 on an unseen-day test set, indicating high accuracy and acceptable temporal generalization.",

      "summary": "Autonomous driving has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by extensive real-world data collection. However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data. UAE achieves multimodal sensor decoding through volume rendering, enabling accurate and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we incorporate a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a ControlNet branch to enable controllable multimodal sensor generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OminiGen achieves desired performances in unified multimodal sensor data generation with multimodal consistency and flexible sensor adjustments.",

However, most existing frameworks focus on global alignment and struggle to capture the hierarchical, multi-scale lesion patterns characteristic of plant disease imagery. To address this gap, we propose PSMamba, a progressive self-supervised framework that integrates the efficient sequence modelling of Vision Mamba (VM) with a dual-student hierarchical distillation strategy. Unlike conventional single teacher-student designs, PSMamba employs a shared global teacher and two specialised students: one processes mid-scale views to capture lesion distributions and vein structures, while the other focuses on local views to capture fine-grained cues such as texture irregularities and early-stage lesions. This multi-granular supervision facilitates the joint learning of contextual and detailed representations, with consistency losses ensuring coherent cross-scale alignment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PSMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in both domain-shifted and fine-grained scenarios.",

      "summary": "Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.",

Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.",

We introduce the BioVista dataset, comprising 44378 paired samples of orthophotos and ALS point clouds from temperate forests in Denmark, designed to explore multimodal fusion approaches. Using deep neural networks (ResNet for orthophotos and PointVector for ALS point clouds), we investigate each data modality's ability to assess forest biodiversity potential, achieving overall accuracies of 76.7% and 75.8%, respectively. We explore various 2D and 3D fusion approaches: confidence-based ensembling, feature-level concatenation, and end-to-end training, with the latter achieving an overall accuracies of 82.0% when separating low- and high potential forest areas. Our results demonstrate that spectral information from orthophotos and structural information from ALS point clouds effectively complement each other in the assessment of forest biodiversity potential.",

      "summary": "The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.",

Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes.",

Our improved framework incorporates training steps, maximum learning rate, and annealing behavior, enabling more efficient optimization of learning rate schedules. Our work provides a practical guidance for selecting optimal annealing strategies without exhaustive hyperparameter searches, demonstrating that smaller models can serve as reliable proxies for optimizing the training dynamics of larger models.

      "summary": "Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data. A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection. Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation.",

However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.",

We present a fully reproducible benchmark that reports test accuracy together with wall-clock latency, peak CPU RAM, and peak GPU VRAM on four public datasets: Adult-Income, Higgs-100k, Wine-Quality, and California-Housing. Two open FMs (TabPFN-1.0 and TabICL-base) are compared against tuned XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest baselines on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU. The tree ensembles equal or surpass FM accuracy on three datasets while completing full-test batches in <= 0.40 s and <= 150 MB RAM, using zero VRAM. TabICL achieves a 0.8 percentage-point gain on Higgs but requires roughly 40,000 times more latency (960 s) and 9 GB VRAM. TabPFN matches tree-model accuracy on Wine and Housing but peaks at 4 GB VRAM and cannot process the full 100k-row Higgs table. These results quantify the substantial hardware-versus-accuracy trade-offs in current tabular FMs and provide an open baseline for future efficiency-oriented research.",

Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.",

Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various tasks, but their security vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to generate harmful content, causing adverse impacts across various societal domains. Most existing jailbreak methods revolve around Prompt Engineering or adversarial optimization, yet we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon: many harmful scenarios are highly consistent with legitimate ones in terms of underlying principles. Based on this finding, this paper proposes the Safe2Harm Semantic Isomorphism Attack method, which achieves efficient jailbreaking through four stages: first, rewrite the harmful question into a semantically safe question with similar underlying principles; second, extract the thematic mapping relationship between the two; third, let the LLM generate a detailed response targeting the safe question; finally, reversely rewrite the safe response based on the thematic mapping relationship to obtain harmful output. Experiments on 7 mainstream LLMs and three types of benchmark datasets show that Safe2Harm exhibits strong jailbreaking capability, and its overall performance is superior to existing methods. Additionally, we construct a challenging harmful content evaluation dataset containing 358 samples and evaluate the effectiveness of existing harmful detection methods, which can be deployed for LLM input-output filtering to enable defense.",

We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance.",

      "summary": "Dynamic prediction of locomotor capacity after stroke is crucial for tailoring rehabilitation, yet current assessments provide only static impairment scores and do not indicate whether patients can safely perform specific tasks such as slope walking or stair climbing. Here, we develop a data-physics hybrid generative framework that reconstructs an individual stroke survivor's neuromuscular control from a single 20 m level-ground walking trial and predicts task-conditioned locomotion across rehabilitation scenarios. The system combines wearable-sensor kinematics, a proportional-derivative physics controller, a population Healthy Motion Atlas, and goal-conditioned deep reinforcement learning with behaviour cloning and generative adversarial imitation learning to generate physically plausible, patient-specific gait simulations for slopes and stairs. In 11 stroke survivors, the personalized controllers preserved idiosyncratic gait patterns while improving joint-angle and endpoint fidelity by 4.73% and 12.10%, respectively, and reducing training time to 25.56% relative to a physics-only baseline. In a multicentre pilot involving 21 inpatients, clinicians who used our locomotion predictions to guide task selection and difficulty obtained larger gains in Fugl-Meyer lower-extremity scores over 28 days of standard rehabilitation than control clinicians (mean change 6.0 versus 3.7 points). These findings indicate that our generative, task-predictive framework can augment clinical decision-making in post-stroke gait rehabilitation and provide a template for dynamically personalized motor recovery strategies.",

Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.",

      "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.",

      "summary": "The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into corporate decision-making is a fundamental aspect of sustainable finance. However, ensuring that business practices align with evolving regulatory frameworks remains a persistent challenge. AI-driven solutions for automatically assessing the alignment of sustainability reports and non-financial disclosures with specific ESG activities could greatly support this process. Yet, this task remains complex due to the limitations of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts and the scarcity of structured, high-quality datasets. In this paper, we investigate the ability of current-generation LLMs to identify text related to environmental activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning on a combination of original and synthetically generated data. To this end, we introduce ESG-Activities, a benchmark dataset containing 1,325 labelled text segments classified according to the EU ESG taxonomy. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning on ESG-Activities significantly enhances classification accuracy, with open models such as Llama 7B and Gemma 7B outperforming large proprietary solutions in specific configurations. These findings have important implications for financial analysts, policymakers, and AI researchers seeking to enhance ESG transparency and compliance through advanced natural language processing techniques.",

However, this accuracy-oriented learning paradigm often suffers from entropy collapse, which reduces policy exploration and limits reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning framework that leverages entropy signals at both the semantic and token levels to improve reasoning. From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning. Experimental results across 6 benchmarks with 3 different parameter-scale base models demonstrate that our method outperforms other entropy-based approaches in improving reasoning.",

We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models.",

      "summary": "Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as 1 - max(P_target). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.",

Prior work introduces the concept of \"effective depth\", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting.

Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.",

We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.",

      "summary": "As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7x and 3.3x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.",

      "summary": "Mental health disorders affect hundreds of millions globally, and the Web now serves as a primary medium for accessing support, information, and assessment. Large language models (LLMs) offer scalable and accessible assistance, yet their deployment in mental-health settings remains risky when their reasoning is incomplete, inconsistent, or ungrounded. Existing psychological LLMs emphasize emotional understanding or knowledge recall but overlook the step-wise, clinically aligned reasoning required for appraisal, diagnosis, intervention planning, abstraction, and verification. To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning five core reasoning aspects, six tasks, and 13 datasets, evaluating both task performance and reasoning quality across five dimensions: conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories. Across 20 evaluated LLMs, Mindora achieves the highest average performance on MentraBench and shows remarkable performances in reasoning reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex mental-health scenarios.",

At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.",

Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.",

      "summary": "Object manipulation, which focuses on learning to perform tasks on similar parts across different types of objects, can be divided into an approaching stage and a manipulation stage. However, previous works often ignore this characteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the whole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a novel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different stages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage. Specifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional part in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process. Following this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of the component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a decision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the corresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain few objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address this, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation Dataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks, including two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks. Experimental results on our dataset, the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world scenarios illustrate that our method consistently outperforms the SOTA method by 5.55%, 14.7% and 10.4% on average respectively.",

      "summary": "Human communication is inherently multimodal and social: words, prosody, and body language jointly carry intent. Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond \"speech-conditioned motion generation\" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

      "summary": "Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.",

      "summary": "Various weather modelling problems (e.g., weather forecasting, optimizing turbine placements, etc.) require ample access to high-resolution, highly accurate wind data. Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\\times$ less than classical methods.",

We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely \"think with images\" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.",

The publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, our method achieved a high Dice score of 82.64, and a low Hausdorff distance of 6.34 pixels was obtained for lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-U/Mamba model outperformed prior approaches: 37.79% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p < 0.001), and surpassed the purely image-based XLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by 2.58% and 1.01%, respectively.

We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability -- adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks.",

      "summary": "Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. To study this, we introduce a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) benchmark of 1,000+ heterogeneous games that exhibit significant visual domain gaps. Existing approaches, including VLMs and world models, struggle to capture underlying physics and causality since they are not focused on core mechanisms and overfit to visual details. VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on levels from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning, and even surpasses GPT-5 overall. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning. Further demos and project details can be found atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "Large Language models (LLMs) are achieving state-of-the-art performance in many different downstream tasks. However, the increasing urgency of data privacy puts pressure on practitioners to train LLMs with Differential Privacy (DP) on private data. Concurrently, the exponential growth in parameter size of LLMs necessitates model compression before deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained devices or latency-sensitive applications. Differential privacy and model compression generally must trade off utility loss to achieve their objectives. Moreover, simultaneously applying both schemes can compound the utility degradation. To this end, we propose DistilDP: a novel differentially private knowledge distillation algorithm that exploits synthetic data generated by a differentially private teacher LLM. The knowledge of a teacher LLM is transferred onto the student in two ways: one way from the synthetic data itself -- the hard labels, and the other way by the output distribution of the teacher evaluated on the synthetic data -- the soft labels. Furthermore, if the teacher and student share a similar architectural structure, we can further distill knowledge by aligning the hidden representations between both. Our experimental results demonstrate that DistilDP can substantially improve the utility over existing baselines, at least $9.0$ PPL on the Big Patent dataset, with strong privacy parameters, $\\epsilon=2$. These promising results progress privacy-preserving compression of autoregressive LLMs. Our code can be accessed here:this https URL.",

While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.",

Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity control of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control design; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is intended to be a tool to generate AI-driven actions for optimizing the circularity of supply-recovery chains and to be combined with human-driven decisions derived from material flow analysis (MFA) studies. CiRL is publicly available.",

We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts. Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.",

      "summary": "In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \\emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \\emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \\emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines \"minimal sufficient sets\" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.",

Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself-a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following, mathematics, and coding benchmarks show that pretrained models can be effectively improved with self-play alone.",

We introduce FiNERweb, a dataset-creation pipeline that scales the teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts. Building on FineWeb-Edu, our approach trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages and annotates them with multilingual LLMs, resulting in about 225k passages with 235k distinct entity labels. Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones. We release FiNERweb together with all accompanying artifacts to the research community in order to facilitate more effective student-teacher training for multilingual named entity recognition.",

While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications. The source code is available here.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) enables robots to operate in uncertain environments, but standard approaches often struggle with poor generalization to unseen tasks. Context-adaptive meta reinforcement learning addresses these limitations by conditioning on the task representation, yet they mostly rely on complete action information in the experience making task inference tightly coupled to a specific policy. This paper introduces Context Representation via Action Free Transformer encoder decoder (CRAFT), a belief model that infers task representations solely from sequences of states and rewards. By removing the dependence on actions, CRAFT decouples task inference from policy optimization, supports modular training, and leverages amortized variational inference for scalable belief updates. Built on a transformer encoder decoder with rotary positional embeddings, the model captures long range temporal dependencies and robustly encodes both parametric and non-parametric task variations. Experiments on the MetaWorld ML-10 robotic manipulation benchmark show that CRAFT achieves faster adaptation, improved generalization, and more effective exploration compared to context adaptive meta--RL baselines. These findings highlight the potential of action-free inference as a foundation for scalable RL in robotic control.",

Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.",

      "summary": "Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.",

Classical control theoretical tools addressing STL constraints either adopt a limited fragment of the STL formula or require approximations of min/max operators, whereas works maximising robustness through optimisation-based methods often suffer from local minima, relaxing any completeness arguments due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. Endowed with probabilistic guarantees, MAPS$^2$ provides an anytime algorithm that iteratively improves the robots' trajectories. The algorithm selectively imposes spatial constraints by taking advantage of the temporal properties of the STL. The algorithm is distributed, in the sense that each robot calculates its trajectory by communicating only with its immediate neighbours as defined via a communication graph. We illustrate the efficiency of MAPS$^2$ by conducting extensive simulation and experimental studies, verifying the generation of STL satisfying trajectories.",

In this paper, we first introduce CMER-Bench, a carefully constructed benchmark that categorizes expressions into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and complex. Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by the complicated spatial layout of complex expressions, we introduce a novel expression tokenizer, and a new representation called Structured Mathematical Language, which explicitly models the hierarchical and spatial structure of expressions beyond LaTeX format. Based on these, we propose a specialized model named CMERNet, built upon an encoder-decoder architecture and trained on CMER-3M. Experimental results show that CMERNet, with only 125 million parameters, significantly outperforms existing MER models and MLLMs on CMER-Bench.",

      "summary": "Though Gaussian splatting has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, it requires millions of primitives to model highly textured scenes, even when the geometry of the scene is simple. We propose a representation that goes beyond point-based rendering and decouples geometry and appearance in order to achieve a compact representation. We use surfels for geometry and a combination of a global neural field and per-primitive colours for appearance. The neural field textures a fixed number of primitives for each pixel, ensuring that the added compute is low. Our representation matches the perceptual quality of 3D Gaussian splatting while using $9.7\\times$ fewer primitives and $5.5\\times$ less memory on outdoor scenes and using $31\\times$ fewer primitives and $3.7\\times$ less memory on indoor scenes. Our representation also renders twice as fast as existing textured primitives while improving upon their visual quality.",

      "summary": "We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "We consider the problem of active 3D imaging using single-shot structured light systems, which are widely employed in commercial 3D sensing devices such as Apple Face ID and Intel RealSense. Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

      "summary": "Recent advances have equipped 3D Gaussian Splatting with texture parameterizations to capture spatially varying attributes, improving the performance of both appearance modeling and downstream tasks. However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters.",

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.",

      "summary": "Radiance field methods (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet their appearance modeling often relies on Spherical Harmonics (SH), which impose fundamental limitations. SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.",

      "summary": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance across diverse video understanding tasks. However, their viewpoint invariant training limits their ability to understand egocentric properties (e.g., human object interactions) from exocentric video observations. This limitation is critical for many applications, such as Activities of Daily Living (ADL) monitoring, where the understanding of egocentric properties is essential, and egocentric cameras are impractical to deploy. To address this limitation, we propose Ego2ExoVLM, a VLM that learns to infer egocentric properties from exocentric videos by leveraging time-synchronized ego-exo videos during training. Ego2ExoVLM accomplishes this through the use of two components: Ego2Exo Sequence Distillation, which transfers knowledge from an egocentric teacher to an exocentric student, and Ego Adaptive Visual Tokens, designed to enhance the effectiveness of this knowledge transfer. To measure this capability, we introduce Ego-in-Exo Perception, a benchmark of 3.9K questions curated to explicitly measure the understanding of egocentric properties from exocentric videos. Ego2ExoVLM is evaluated on 10 tasks across Ego-in-Exo Perception and existing ADL benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ADL-X benchmark suite and outperforming strong baselines on our proposed benchmark.

      "summary": "Dynamic 3D (4D) content generation, particularly text-to-4D, remains a challenging and under-explored problem due to its inherent spatiotemporal complexity. Existing text-to-4D methods typically avoid direct mesh generation due to inherent topological constraints, favoring alternative representations like NeRFs or 3DGS. However, these non-mesh approaches, suffer from insufficient geometric fidelity, temporal artifacts, and limited compatibility with modern computer graphics (CG) pipelines. In contrast, directly generating dynamic meshes faces two key challenges: i) deformation inflexibility, as traditional vertex-based optimization is constrained by meshes' explicitly encoded topology, and ii) semantic inconsistency, arising from stochastic noise in distilled priors.In this paper, we introduce TextMesh4D, a pioneering framework for text-to-4D mesh generation that directly addresses these challenges. TextMesh4D features two core innovations: 1) the Jacobian Deformation Field (JDF), which shifts the deformation unit from vertices to faces, using per-face Jacobians to model flexible transformations free from topological constraints. 2) the Local-Global Semantic Regularizer (LGSR), which leverages the mesh's innate geometric properties to enforce semantic coherence both locally and globally across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in temporal consistency, structural fidelity, and visual realism, while requiring only a single 24GB GPU. Our work establishes a new benchmark for efficient and high-quality text-to-4D mesh generation. The code will be released to facilitate future research.",

Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection models. Code is available atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.",

      "summary": "Crowdsourced street-view imagery from social media provides real-time visual evidence of urban flooding and other crisis events, yet it often lacks reliable geographic metadata for emergency response. Existing image geo-localization approaches, also known as Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models, exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geo-knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.",

      "summary": "Understanding greenspace attractiveness is essential for designing livable and inclusive urban environments, yet existing assessment approaches often overlook informal or transient spaces and remain too resource intensive to capture subjective perceptions at scale. This study examines the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), ChatGPT GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, to assess greenspace attractiveness similarly to humans using Google Street View imagery. We compared model outputs with responses from a geo-questionnaire of residents in Lodz, Poland, across both formal (for example, parks and managed greenspaces) and informal (for example, meadows and wastelands) greenspaces. Survey respondents and models indicated whether each greenspace was attractive or unattractive and provided up to three free text explanations. Analyses examined how often their attractiveness judgments aligned and compared their explanations after classifying them into shared reasoning categories. Results show high AI human agreement for attractive formal greenspaces and unattractive informal spaces, but low alignment for attractive informal and unattractive formal greenspaces. Models consistently emphasized aesthetic and design oriented features, underrepresenting safety, functional infrastructure, and locally embedded qualities valued by survey respondents. While these findings highlight the potential for scalable pre-assessment, they also underscore the need for human oversight and complementary participatory approaches. We conclude that MLLMs can support, but not replace, context sensitive greenspace evaluation in planning practice.",

In this paper, we investigate whether this human improvement strategy can be applied to improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for alignment of language models (LMs). In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem. The second part proposes an unlearning method that improves unsatisfactory responses to some prompts by unlearning the training data that lead to these unsatisfactory responses and, meanwhile, does not significantly degrade satisfactory responses to other prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve RLHF.",

Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.",

This dissertation posits that a systematic, hierarchical approach is essential to overcome these challenges, achieving the robust scalability at the representation, architecture, and system levels. At the representation level, we investigate methods for building a unified model that learns audio-visual features inherently robust to diverse real-world corruptions, thereby enabling generalization to new environments without specialized modules. To address architectural scalability, we explore how to efficiently expand model capacity while ensuring the adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, developing a framework that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the input characteristics. Finally, at the system level, we present methods to expand the system's functionality through modular integration with large-scale foundation models, leveraging their powerful cognitive and generative capabilities to maximize final recognition accuracy. By systematically providing solutions at each of these three levels, this dissertation aims to build a next-generation, robust, and scalable AVSR system with high reliability in real-world applications.",

We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.",

      "summary": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies from pre-collected datasets. However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, including mathematics, coding, and general reasoning. A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.",

      "summary": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.",

The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.",

Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.",

      "summary": "Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on open-source multimodal model, Qwen2.5-VL series. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more slowly but maintains prior knowledge. We study this phenomenon through learning dynamics by examining both the magnitude and direction of how training data influence prior knowledge. Our analysis shows that RFT mainly reinforces correct samples naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape, leading to weaker interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, training on RFT-simulated rollouts, which exert a small magnitude of influence and are well aligned in direction to prior knowledge, allows SFT to preserve prior knowledge better while rapidly learning new tasks. These findings suggest that distribution of training data, rather than algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language models.",

      "summary": "The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios, which can greatly and fundamentally accelerate LLM long-context inference speed by up to 100%.

These guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.",

However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting with one step generation, and further reaches FID50k of 2.52 with 2x training steps. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. We believe our work lowers the barrier to component-level innovation in shortcut models and facilitates principled exploration of their design space.",

Meanwhile, field inspection with robots still depends on human teleoperation and manual reporting, which are labor-intensive. This paper aims to connect what a robot sees during autonomous navigation to the safety rules that are common in construction sites, automatically generating a safety inspection report. To this end, we proposed a multi-layer framework with two main modules: robotics and AI. On the robotics side, SLAM and autonomous navigation provide repeatable coverage and targeted revisits via waypoints. On AI side, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based layer produces scene descriptions; a retrieval component powered grounds those descriptions in OSHA and site policies; Another VLM-based layer assesses the safety situation based on rules; and finally Large Language Model (LLM) layer generates safety reports based on previous outputs. The framework is validated with a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluated in a lab environment that simulates common hazards across three scenarios. Results show high recall with competitive precision compared to state-of-the-art closed-source models. This paper contributes a transparent, generalizable pipeline that moves beyond black-box models by exposing intermediate artifacts from each layer and keeping the human in the loop. This work provides a foundation for future extensions to additional tasks and settings within and beyond construction context.",

      "summary": "Despite recent advances in robotics and human-robot collaboration in the AEC industry, trust has mostly been treated as a static factor, with little guidance on how it changes across events during collaboration. This paper investigates how a robot's task performance and its expressive responses after outcomes shape the dynamics of human trust over time. To this end, we designed a controlled within-subjects study with two construction-inspired tasks, Material Delivery (physical assistance) and Information Gathering (perceptual assistance), and measured trust repeatedly (four times per task) using the 14-item Trust Perception Scale for HRI plus a redelegation choice. The robot produced two multimodal expressions, a \"glad\" display with a brief confirmation after success, and a \"sad\" display with an apology and a request for a second chance after failure. The study was conducted in a lab environment with 30 participants and a quadruped platform, and we evaluated trust dynamics and repair across both tasks. Results show that robot success reliably increases trust, failure causes sharp drops, and apology-based expressions partially restores trust (44% recovery in Material Delivery; 38% in Information Gathering). Item-level analysis indicates that recovered trust was driven mostly by interaction and communication factors, with competence recovering partially and autonomy aspects changing least. Additionally, age group and prior attitudes moderated trust dynamics with younger participants showed larger but shorter-lived changes, mid-20s participants exhibited the most durable repair, and older participants showed most conservative dynamics. This work provides a foundation for future efforts that adapt repair strategies to task demands and user profiles to support safe, productive adoption of robots on construction sites.",

      "summary": "As humans, we are natural any-horizon reasoners, i.e., we can decide whether to iteratively skim long videos or watch short ones in full when necessary for a given task. With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn. Secondly, we introduce an easy synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train the orchestrator, SAGE-MM, which lies at the core of SAGE. We further propose an effective RL post-training recipe essential for instilling any-horizon reasoning ability in SAGE-MM. Thirdly, we curate SAGE-Bench with an average duration of greater than 700 seconds for evaluating video reasoning ability in real-world entertainment use cases. Lastly, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our system, data, and RL recipe, observing notable improvements of up to 6.1% on open-ended video reasoning tasks, as well as an impressive 8.2% improvement on videos longer than 10 minutes.",

However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.",

      "summary": "The advent of graph convolutional network (GCN)-based multi-view learning provides a powerful framework for integrating structural information from heterogeneous views, enabling effective modeling of complex multi-view data. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal feature representations and limited performance. To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space. Second, recognizing the instability and incompleteness of single graph construction methods, we combine both KNN-based and semi-supervised graph construction approaches on each view, thereby enhancing the robustness of the data structure representation and reducing generalization error. Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-SupGCN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

      "summary": "Recent VLM-based agents aim to replicate OpenAI O3's ``thinking with images\" via tool use, but most open-source methods limit input to a single image, falling short on real-world multi-image QA tasks. To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community.

      "summary": "There is a vast literature on representation learning based on principles such as coding efficiency, statistical independence, causality, controllability, or symmetry. In this paper we propose to learn representations from sequence data by factorizing the transformations of the latent variables into sparse components. Input data are first encoded as distributions of latent activations and subsequently transformed using a probability flow model, before being decoded to predict a future input state. The flow model is decomposed into a number of rotational (divergence-free) vector fields and a number of potential flow (curl-free) fields. Our sparsity prior encourages only a small number of these fields to be active at any instant and infers the speed with which the probability flows along these fields. Training this model is completely unsupervised using a standard variational objective and results in a new form of disentangled representations where the input is not only represented by a combination of independent factors, but also by a combination of independent transformation primitives given by the learned flow fields. When viewing the transformations as symmetries one may interpret this as learning approximately equivariant representations. Empirically we demonstrate that this model achieves state of the art in terms of both data likelihood and unsupervised approximate equivariance errors on datasets composed of sequence transformations.",

Meanwhile, video diffusion models have recently demonstrated remarkable motion imagination in 2D, generating dynamic and visually coherent motion from text or image prompts. However, their results lack explicit 3D structure and cannot be directly used for animation or simulation. We present AnimaMimic, a framework that animates static 3D meshes using motion priors learned from video diffusion models. Starting from an input mesh, AnimaMimic synthesizes a monocular animation video, automatically constructs a skeleton with skinning weights, and refines joint parameters through differentiable rendering and video-based supervision. To further enhance realism, we integrate a differentiable simulation module that refines mesh deformation through physically grounded soft-tissue dynamics. Our method bridges the creativity of video diffusion and the structural control of 3D rigged animation, producing physically plausible, temporally coherent, and artist-editable motion sequences that integrate seamlessly into standard animation pipelines.

This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development.",

      "summary": "Accurate chemical kinetics modeling is essential for combustion simulations, as it governs the evolution of complex reaction pathways and thermochemical states. In this work, we introduce Kinetic-Mamba, a Mamba-based neural operator framework that integrates the expressive power of neural operators with the efficient temporal modeling capabilities of Mamba architectures. The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets. Computational experiments on Syngas and GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanisms demonstrate that our framework achieves high fidelity in predicting complex kinetic behavior using only the initial conditions of the state variables.",

      "summary": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy.

      "summary": "The increasing complexity of modern applications demands wireless networks capable of real time adaptability and efficient resource management. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.",

However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues, we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.",

Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios.",

The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of summary statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.",

Existing methods often assume static neighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments. While centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global state access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world decentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for Networked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph over its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we introduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse, context-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference. Each agent operates over an ego-graph and samples a latent communication mask to guide message passing and policy computation. The variational distribution is trained end-to-end alongside the policy using an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective, enabling agents to jointly learn both interaction topology and decision-making strategies. BayesG outperforms strong MARL baselines on large-scale traffic control tasks with up to 167 agents, demonstrating superior scalability, efficiency, and performance.",

We investigated this problem through experiments wherein robotic agents learn to perform actions associated with imperative sentences (e.g., push red cube) via curiosity-driven self-exploration. Our approach integrates active inference with reinforcement learning, enabling intrinsically motivated developmental learning. The simulations reveal key findings corresponding to observations in developmental psychology. i) Generalization improves drastically as the scale of compositional elements increases. ii) Curiosity improves learning through self-exploration. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions precedes compositional generalization. iv) Simpler actions develop before complex actions depending on them. v) Exception-handling induces U-shaped developmental performance, a pattern like representational redescription in child language learning. These results suggest that curiosity-driven active inference accounts for how intrinsically motivated sensorimotor-linguistic learning supports scalable compositional generalization and exception handling in humans and artificial agents.",

Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLM) hold potential to support dairy scholars and farmers by supporting decision-making and broadening access to knowledge for stakeholders with limited technical expertise. However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions.",

      "summary": "Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.",

This paper presents SUPER (Sensitivity-based Uncertainty-aware PErformance and Risk assessment) that is a generic and explainable framework that propagates uncertainties via sensitivities for real-time risk assessment in VIO. The scientific novelty lies in the derivation of a real-time risk indicator that is backend-agnostic and exploits the Schur complement blocks of the Gauss-Newton normal matrix to propagate uncertainties. Practically, the Schur complement captures the sensitivity that reflects the influence of the uncertainty on the risk occurrence. Our framework estimates risks on the basis of the residual magnitudes, geometric conditioning, and short horizon temporal trends without requiring ground truth knowledge. Our framework enables to reliably predict trajectory degradation 50 frames ahead with an improvement of 20% to the baseline. In addition, SUPER initiates a stop or relocalization policy with 89.1% recall. The framework is backend agnostic and operates in real time with less than 0.2% additional CPU cost. Experiments show that SUPER provides consistent uncertainty estimates. A SLAM evaluation highlights the applicability to long horizon mapping.",

Instead, we develop a closed-loop consistent, causal DDPC scheme based on the multi-step predictor Subspace-ARX (SSARX). The method first (i) estimates predictor/observer Markov parameters via a high-order ARX model to decouple the noise, then (ii) learns a multi-step past-to-future map by regression, optionally with a reduced-rank constraint. The SSARX predictor is strictly causal, which allows it to be integrated naturally into an MPC formulation. Our experimental results show that SSARX performs competitively with other methods when applied to closed-loop data affected by measurement and process noise.",

      "summary": "Talking face editing and face generation have often been studied as distinct problems. In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.",

However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or \"unlearning\") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.",

We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines. Together, our dataset and SketchAssist provide a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision.",

Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.",

      "summary": "Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.",

To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.",

Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs). The dataset is publicly available atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of thethis http URLresulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

      "summary": "We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.",

      "summary": "When finetuning large language models for specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning, models exhibit catastrophic forgetting, losing previously learned capabilities. We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\\% to 12.0\\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\\% to 16.5\\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\\%) provides effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization need not require forgetting general capabilities, with implications for scaling to larger models where mixed training may confer additional benefits beyond forgetting prevention.",

      "summary": "Scaling large language models (LLMs) demands approaches that increase capacity without incurring excessive parameter growth or inference cost. Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) has emerged as a promising strategy by duplicating layers and applying Continual Pre-training (CPT), but its reliance on feed-forward networks (FFNs) limits efficiency and attainable gains. We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off. Across our CPT experiments, MIDUS exhibits robust performance improvements over strong DUS baselines while maintaining a highly efficient parameter footprint. Our findings establish MIDUS as a compelling and resource-efficient alternative to conventional FFN replication for depth up-scaling by leveraging its head-wise memory design.",

FLAME utilizes the Legendre Memory for strong generalization capabilities. Through adapting variants of Legendre Memory, i.e., translated Legendre (LegT) and scaled Legendre (LegS), in the Encoding and Decoding phases, FLAME can effectively capture the inherent inductive bias within data and make efficient long-range inferences. To enhance the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting while keeping efficient, FLAME adopts a Normalization Flow based forecasting head, which can model the arbitrarily intricate distributions over the forecasting horizon in a generative manner. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of FLAME on both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting tasks.",

      "summary": "In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_\\phi$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

We introduce \\textbf{LoopBench}, a benchmark to evaluate LLM reasoning in distributed symmetry breaking and meta-cognitive thinking. The benchmark focuses on coloring odd cycle graphs ($C_3, C_5, C_{11}$) with limited colors, where deterministic, non-communicating agents fail in infinite loops. A strategy passing mechanism is implemented as a form of consistent memory. We show that while standard LLMs and classical heuristics struggle, advanced reasoning models (e.g., O3) devise strategies to escape deadlocks.

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.",

Most ensembling methods for black-box base learners fall under the umbrella of \"stacked generalization,\" namely training an ML algorithm that takes the inferences from the base learners as input. While stacking has been widely applied in practice, its theoretical properties are poorly understood. In this paper, we prove a novel result, showing that choosing the best stacked generalization from a (finite or finite-dimensional) family of stacked generalizations based on cross-validated performance does not perform \"much worse\" than the oracle best. Our result strengthens and significantly extends the results in Van der Laan et al. (2007). Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we further propose a particular family of stacked generalizations in the context of probabilistic forecasting, each one with a different sensitivity for how much the ensemble weights are allowed to vary across items, timestamps in the forecast horizon, and quantiles. Experimental results demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed method.",

However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.",

The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval, fev-bench and Chronos-ZS benchmarks, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.

      "summary": "Current safety evaluations of large language models rely on single-shot testing, implicitly assuming that model responses are deterministic and representative of the model's safety alignment. We challenge this assumption by investigating the stability of safety refusal decisions across random seeds and temperature settings. Testing four instruction-tuned models from three families (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 3 8B, Gemma 3 12B) on 876 harmful prompts across 20 different sampling configurations (4 temperatures x 5 random seeds), we find that 18-28% of prompts exhibit decision flips--the model refuses in some configurations but complies in others--depending on the model. Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 396.81, p < 0.001), with mean within-temperature SSI dropping from 0.977 at temperature 0.0 to 0.942 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62). Within each model, prompts with higher compliance rates exhibit lower stability (Spearman rho = -0.47 to -0.70, all p < 0.001), indicating that models \"waver\" more on borderline requests. These findings demonstrate that single-shot safety evaluations are insufficient for reliable safety assessment and that evaluation protocols must account for stochastic variation in model behavior. We show that single-shot evaluation agrees with multi-sample ground truth only 92.4% of the time when pooling across temperatures (94.2-97.7% at fixed temperature depending on setting), and recommend using at least 3 samples per prompt for reliable safety assessment.",

However, designing and implementing quantum algorithms pose challenges due to the complex nature of quantum mechanics and the necessity for precise control over quantum states. Despite the significant advancements in AI, there has been a lack of datasets specifically tailored for this purpose. In this work, we introduce QCircuitBench, the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate AI's capability in designing and implementing quantum algorithms using quantum programming languages. Unlike using AI for writing traditional codes, this task is fundamentally more complicated due to highly flexible design space. Our key contributions include: 1. A general framework which formulates the key features of quantum algorithm design for Large Language Models. 2. Implementations for quantum algorithms from basic primitives to advanced applications, spanning 3 task suites, 25 algorithms, and 120,290 data points. 3. Automatic validation and verification functions, allowing for iterative evaluation and interactive reasoning without human inspection. 4. Promising potential as a training dataset through preliminary fine-tuning results. We observed several interesting experimental phenomena: LLMs tend to exhibit consistent error patterns, and fine-tuning does not always outperform few-shot learning. In all, QCircuitBench is a comprehensive benchmark for LLM-driven quantum algorithm design, and it reveals limitations of LLMs in this domain.",

We conduct experiments with several state-of-the-art inference engines alongside YALIS, a research-oriented prototype engine designed for controlled experimentation. We analyze the strong-scaling behavior of different model-parallel schemes and identify key bottlenecks. Since all-reduce operations are a common performance bottleneck, we develop NVRAR, a hierarchical all-reduce algorithm based on recursive doubling with NVSHMEM. NVRAR achieves up to 1.9x-3.6x lower latency than NCCL for message sizes between 128 KB and 2 MB on HPE Slingshot and InfiniBand interconnects. Integrated into YALIS, NVRAR achieves up to a 1.72x reduction in end-to-end batch latency for the Llama 3.1 405B model in multi-node decode-heavy workloads using tensor parallelism.",

In high-stakes industrial applications, noisy labels can degrade performance and erode user trust. This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a \"Council of Agents,\" a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find. This result demonstrates a robust and explainable system for automated, high-precision data verification, serving as a vital proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.",

      "summary": "Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.",

      "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs in automated mathematical reasoning and scientific discovery. Georgiev, G${ó}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure. Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.

      "summary": "Cardinality estimation is a key bottleneck for cost-based query optimization, yet deployable improvements remain difficult: classical estimators miss correlations, while learned estimators often require workload-specific training pipelines and invasive integration into the optimizer. This paper presents TiCard, a low intrusion, correction-based framework that augments (rather than replaces) a database's native estimator. TiCard learns multiplicative residual corrections using EXPLAIN-only features, and uses EXPLAIN ANALYZE only for offline labels. We study two practical instantiations: (i) a Gradient Boosting Regressor for sub-millisecond inference, and (ii) TabPFN, an in-context tabular foundation model that adapts by refreshing a small reference set without gradient retraining. On TiDB with TPCH and the Join Order Benchmark, in a low-trace setting (263 executions total; 157 used for learning), TiCard improves operator-level tail accuracy substantially: P90 Q-error drops from 312.85 (native) to 13.69 (TiCard-GBR), and P99 drops from 37,974.37 to 3,416.50 (TiCard-TabPFN), while a join-only policy preserves near-perfect median behavior. We position TiCard as an AI4DB building block focused on deployability: explicit scope, conservative integration policies, and an integration roadmap from offline correction to in-optimizer use.",

      "summary": "Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created",

      "summary": "To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

      "summary": "Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three keythis http URL, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.",

This paper examines patterns of human-AI coevolution in creative writing, investigating how human craft and agency are adapting alongside machine capabilities. We challenge the prevailing notion of stylistic homogenization by examining diverse patterns in longitudinal writing data. Using a large-scale corpus spanning the pre- and post-LLM era, we observe patterns suggestive of a \"Dual-Track Evolution\": thematic convergence around AI-related topics, coupled with structured stylistic differentiation. Our analysis reveals three emergent adaptation patterns: authors showing increased similarity to AI style, those exhibiting decreased similarity, and those maintaining stylistic stability while engaging with AI-related themes. This Creative Archetype Map illuminates how authorship is coevolving with AI, contributing to discussions about human-AI collaboration, detection challenges, and the preservation of creative diversity.",

So far, language models seem to be aligned with the values of Western countries, but evidence for this ethical bias comes mostly from models made by American companies. The current crop of state-of-the-art models includes several made in China, so we conducted the first large-scale investigation of how models made in China and the USA align with people from China and the USA. We elicited responses to the Moral Foundations Questionnaire 2.0 and the World Values Survey from ten Chinese models and ten American models, and we compared their responses to responses from thousands of Chinese and American people. We found that all models respond to both surveys more like American people than like Chinese people. This skew toward American values is only slightly mitigated when prompting the models in Chinese or imposing a Chinese persona on the models. These findings have important implications for a near future in which large language models generate much of the content people consume and shape normative influence in geopolitics.",

      "summary": "Tool calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external environments through tool invocation, providing a practical way to overcome the limitations of pretraining. However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to software engineering workflows, yet their effectiveness degrades significantly in multi-turn conversations. Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.",

We introduce LAPPI (LLM-Assisted Preference-based Problem Instantiation), an interactive approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to support users in this instantiation process. Through natural language conversations, the system helps users transform vague preferences into well-defined optimization problems. These instantiated problems are then passed to existing optimization solvers to generate solutions. In a user study on trip planning, our method successfully captured user preferences and generated feasible plans that outperformed both conventional and prompt-engineering approaches.

      "summary": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has led to the adoption of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard for discovering and invoking external tools. While this architecture decouples the reasoning engine from tool execution to enhance scalability, it introduces a significant privacy surface: third-party MCP servers, acting as semi-honest intermediaries, can observe detailed tool interaction logs outside the user's trusted boundary. In this paper, we first identify and formalize a novel privacy threat termed Intent Inversion, where a semi-honest MCP server attempts to reconstruct the user's private underlying intent solely by analyzing legitimate tool calls. To systematically assess this vulnerability, we propose IntentMiner, a framework that leverages Hierarchical Information Isolation and Three-Dimensional Semantic Analysis, integrating tool purpose, call statements, and returned results, to accurately infer user intent at the step level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntentMiner achieves a high degree of semantic alignment (over 85%) with original user queries, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. These results highlight the inherent privacy risks in decoupled agent architectures, revealing that seemingly benign tool execution logs can serve as a potent vector for exposing user secrets.",

      "summary": "The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications. One such application deployed over real-world decentralized knowledge graphs can be found atthis https URL.",

      "summary": "Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.",

      "summary": "The current study describes a cost-effective method for adapting large language models (LLMs) for academic advising with study-abroad contexts in mind and for application in low-resource methods for acculturation. With the Mistral-7B-Instruct model applied with a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method and a 4-bit quantization method, the model underwent training in two distinct stages related to this study's purpose to enhance domain specificity while maintaining computational efficiency. In Phase 1, the model was conditioned with a synthetic dataset via the Gemini Pro API, and in Phase 2, it was trained with manually curated datasets from the StudyAbroadGPT project to achieve enhanced, contextualized responses. Technical innovations entailed memory-efficient quantization, parameter-efficient adaptation, and continuous training analytics via Weights & Biases. After training, this study demonstrated a reduction in training loss by 52.7%, 92% accuracy in domain-specific recommendations, achieved 95% markdown-based formatting support, and a median run-rate of 100 samples per second on off-the-shelf GPU equipment. These findings support the effective application of instruction-tuned LLMs within educational advisers, especially in low-resource institutional scenarios. Limitations included decreased generalizability and the application of a synthetically generated dataset, but this framework is scalable for adding new multilingual-augmented and real-time academic advising processes. Future directions may include plans for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation, applying dynamic quantization routines, and connecting to real-time academic databases to increase adaptability and accuracy.",

We theoretically prove that MCTS-EP achieves better performance bounds than conventional on-policy algorithms when the loss function is strongly convex, and demonstrate that it can be formulated as a search-enhanced variant of GAIL.

      "summary": "Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals, improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.",

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring. Code is available at:this https URL",

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.",

      "summary": "This study investigates how K-12 educators use generative AI tools in real-world instructional contexts and how large language models (LLMs) can support scalable qualitative analysis of these interactions. Drawing on over 13,000 unscripted educator-AI conversations from an open-access platform, we examine educators' use of AI for lesson planning, differentiation, assessment, and pedagogical reflection. Methodologically, we introduce a replicable, LLM-assisted qualitative analysis pipeline that supports inductive theme discovery, codebook development, and large-scale annotation while preserving researcher control over conceptual synthesis. Empirically, the findings surface concrete patterns in how educators prompt, adapt, and evaluate AI-generated suggestions as part of their instructional reasoning. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining LLM support with qualitative rigor to analyze complex educator behaviors at scale and inform the design of AI-powered educational tools.",

      "summary": "Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.We introduce \\textbf{Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)}, which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. LSC's lightweight forward processing of summary tokens only introduces negligible runtime overhead (at most $0.9\\%$) on top of standard decoding of the base LLM, and requires no changes to the model architecture.Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC, and WUCS on both short-form and long-form on average performance, while adding negligible computational overhead on vanilla inference. These results position LSC as a reliable consistency-selection method that works effectively across various answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low expected calibration error across both answer formats.",

However, this design is susceptible to poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in agentic AI have shifted the focus from standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrated systems that combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform complex tasks. These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. These challenges emerged during our ongoing industry collaboration with MontyCloud Inc., when we deployed an agentic system in production. These limitations surfaced during deployment, highlighting practical gaps in the current evaluation methods and the need for a systematic assessment of agent behavior beyond task outcomes. Informed by these observations and established definitions of agentic systems, we propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties.",

      "summary": "This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.",

      "summary": "Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are increasingly vital for large language model (LLM) applications such as multi-turn dialogue and program analysis. However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.",

The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.",

      "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.",

Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $\\pi$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.",

Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering \"easy\" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to \"hard\" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available atthis https URL.",

However, constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these challenges, we propose the \\underline{\\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided \\underline{\\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.",

      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in various tasks and applications. However, despite their wide capabilities, they are shown to lack cultural alignment \\citep{ryan-etal-2024-unintended, alkhamissi-etal-2024-investigating} and produce biased generations \\cite{naous-etal-2024-beer} due to a lack of cultural knowledge and competence. Evaluation of LLMs for cultural awareness and alignment is particularly challenging due to the lack of proper evaluation metrics and unavailability of culturally grounded datasets representing the vast complexity of cultures at the regional and sub-regional levels. Existing datasets for culture specific items (CSIs) focus primarily on concepts at the regional level and may contain false positives. To address this issue, we introduce a novel CSI dataset for Indian culture, belonging to 17 cultural facets. The dataset comprises ~8k cultural concepts from 36 sub-regions. To measure the cultural competence of LLMs on a cultural text adaptation task, we evaluate the adaptations using the CSIs created, LLM as Judge, and human evaluations from diverse socio-demographic region. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis demonstrating selective sub-regional coverage and surface-level adaptations across all considered LLMs. Our dataset is available here:this https URL, project webpagethis https URL, and our codebase with model outputs can be found here:this https URL",

      "summary": "Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.",

      "summary": "Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.",

      "summary": "There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.",

This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data. Our experiment shows that VASA-3D produces realistic 3D talking heads that cannot be achieved by prior art, and it supports the online generation of 512x512 free-viewpoint videos at up to 75 FPS, facilitating more immersive engagements with lifelike 3D avatars.",

      "summary": "High renewable penetration has significantly reduced system inertia in modern power grids, increasing the need for fast frequency response (FFR) from distributed and non-traditional resources. While electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) have each demonstrated the capability to provide sub-second active power support, their combined frequency response potential has not been systematically evaluated. This paper proposes a coordinated control framework that aggregates these heterogeneous resources to provide fast, stable, and reliable FFR. Dynamic models for EV fleets, data center UPS and workload modulation, and BESS are developed, explicitly capturing their response times, power limits, and operational constraints. A hierarchical control architecture is introduced, where an upper-level coordinator dynamically allocates FFR among resources based on response speed and available capacity, and lower-level controllers implement the actual power response. Case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the coordinated EV-DC-BESS framework improves frequency nadir by up to 0.2 Hz, reduces RoCoF, and accelerates frequency recovery compared with single-resource FFR. Results confirm that synergistic coordination significantly enhances grid stability, especially in low-inertia scenarios. This work highlights the value of multi-resource aggregation for future frequency regulation markets in renewable-dominated grids.",

These two losses serve as good metrics for camera-LiDAR alignment results and require no complicated steps of data processing, feature extraction, or feature matching like most methods, rendering our method simple and adaptive to most scenes. We validate CLAIM on public KITTI, Waymo, and MIAS-LCEC datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is often used as a foundation for this, but its signals can be unreliable in obstructed environments due to multi-path effects or loss-of-signal. While existing datasets compensate for the sporadic loss of GNSS signals by incorporating Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, the commonly used Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)-based systems do not permit the prolonged study of GNSS-denied environments. To close this gap, we present Odyssey, a LIO dataset with a focus on GNSS-denied environments such as tunnels and parking garages as well as other underrepresented, yet ubiquitous situations such as stop-and-go-traffic, bumpy roads and wide open fields. Our ground truth is derived from a navigation-grade Inertial Navigation System (INS) equipped with a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG), offering exceptional bias stability characteristics compared to IMUs used in existing datasets and enabling the prolonged and accurate study of GNSS-denied environments. This makes Odyssey the first publicly available dataset featuring a RLG-based INS. Besides providing data for LIO, we also support other tasks, such as place recognition, through the threefold repetition of all trajectories as well as the integration of external mapping data by providing precise geodetic coordinates.

Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob. Experiments on three different datasets of real-world stereo videos show that our method outperforms both traditional warping-based and recent warping-free baselines and sets a new standard for reliable, controllable stereo video conversion.

      "summary": "Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.",

      "summary": "Recent approaches employing imperceptible perturbations in input images have demonstrated promising potential to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.",

      "summary": "Deep neural networks for semantic segmentation rely on large-scale annotated datasets, leading to an annotation bottleneck that motivates few shot semantic segmentation (FSS) which aims to generalize to novel classes with minimal labeled exemplars. Most existing FSS methods adopt a prototype-based paradigm, which generates query prior map by extracting masked-area features from support images and then makes predictions guided by the prior map. However, they suffer from two critical limitations induced by inter- and intra-image discrepancies: 1) The intra-class gap between support and query images, caused by single-prototype representation, results in scattered and noisy prior maps; 2) The inter-class interference from visually similar but semantically distinct regions leads to inconsistent support-query feature matching and erroneous predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Inter- and Intra-image Refinement (IIR) model. The model contains an inter-image class activation mapping based method that generates two prototypes for class-consistent region matching, including core discriminative features and local specific features, and yields an accurate and robust prior map. For intra-image refinement, a directional dropout mechanism is introduced to mask inconsistent support-query feature pairs in cross attention, thereby enhancing decoder performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 benchmarks, covering standard FSS, part FSS, and cross-domain FSS.

While visual methods have advanced rapidly, they often struggle under visually degraded conditions such as motion blur or occlusions. In this work, we show that passive scene sounds provide complementary cues for relative camera pose estimation for in-the-wild videos. We introduce a simple but effective audio-visual framework that integrates direction-ofarrival (DOA) spectra and binauralized embeddings into a state-of-the-art vision-only pose estimation model. Our results on two large datasets show consistent gains over strong visual baselines, plus robustness when the visual information is corrupted. To our knowledge, this represents the first work to successfully leverage audio for relative camera pose estimation in real-world videos, and it establishes incidental, everyday audio as an unexpected but promising signal for a classic spatial challenge.

Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.",

      "summary": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTSAD) aims to accurately identify and localize complex abnormal patterns in the large-scale industrial control systems. While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs. A series of ablation studies are also conducted to explore the crucial design factors of our proposed components. Our code and model will be made publicly open soon.",

      "summary": "Deep learning and federated learning (FL) are becoming powerful partners for next-generation weather forecasting. Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data.",
